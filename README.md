## Introduction

### 0.1 Purpose
This project is to help students prepare for their PhD/Graduate School. Supervisors may also find it useful.
  
Ideally you should read through the list and the books before you start graduate school, although students at any stage of their graduate training (and perhaps early-career researchers) can benefit from this project.

Many students (including me years ago) came to graduate school underprepared, and supervisors are often deprived of time and may not be able to offer more holistic training and personal development beyond research.  
  
This project aims to develop and offer a more systematic understanding of graduate studies and more holistic training of graduate students—hence reimagining what graduate education can do and can be.  
  
### 0.2 Terminology
I use 'graduate school' and 'graduate students' for consistency, or just 'PhD' as shorthand. For research supervision, I use 'advisor' and 'supervisor' interchangeably.

I use mixed terms from both the US and the UK/Commonwealth academic systems.

For instance, a book-length PhD research is called a 'dissertation' in the US, but a 'thesis' in the UK system. To add to the confusion, a shorter piece of research is called a 'thesis' in the former, but a 'dissertation' in the latter.

Plus, 'dissertation committee' is mainly a US thing, and so is the expression of 'ABD' ('all but dissertation'). These terms may be confusing if you are not in the US or not familiar with its graduate training system.

For job search, the conventions, processes, and terminology also differ in the US, the UK/Australasia, continental Europe, and other countries and territories. 'Tenure' and 'tenure-track' are used in the US (and have been borrowed by an increasing number of universities elsewhere), which is equivalent to 'permanent', 'continuing', or 'confirmation-path' in some other countries. I use 'career-track' as shorthand.

Don't worry if these seem confusing. You'll get the hang of it as you progress towards your PhD (and future career if you work in academia).

### 0.3 Areas/Disciplines
I was trained across the social science and the arts and humanities, with a long-term interest in other subjects including science, business, and other theoretical and applied areas.

This project was developed in HASS (Humanities and Social Sciences) but should also benefit students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).

Overall, I draw insights from many areas and sectors of academe and society, and this project is interdisciplinary (the way I intended).  
  
All the so-called ‘disciplines’ and ‘boundaries’ are man-made and artificial in nature, albeit not arbitrary. Think in systems, not in disciplines.  
  
### 0.4 Disclaimer
This project is based on my personal philosophy and shaped by my experience. Your supervisors may have different views. Always check with them.

This is an ongoing project that will take years to develop. It is time-consuming as I need to select and read a large number of books and other resources to make recommendations and keep them up to date. Some of these books and resources are no longer useful for me but will be for the students. I also constantly think about these issues and constantly re-evaluate my approaches to make changes and updates regularly. The mental work as well as reading and writing already took me hundreds of hours before this project first went public. It will continue to take more time to build and maintain. 
  
Keep in mind that this project is to inspire new ways of thinking and explore new approaches to graduate training. I have my principles that you may not necessarily agree with, and the world keeps changing and the way we think and train students must change accordingly (we have been kicking the can down the road for too long and missed many opportunities). Covid-19 has signaled an epochal shift (and I returned to academia during the pandemic) so let’s take this opportunity and do something good.  
  
I welcome feedback and input from students, advisors, and everyone else. I'd like to keep this project in [perpetual beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_beta). It is a Project as a Service (PaaS) that I (and hopefully my students and others) can keep updating.

## 1. Philosophy of PhD Training
### 1.1 What is a PhD?
So, *qu'est-ce que le PhD* (what is the PhD)?

Check out [The Illustrated Guide to a Ph.D.](https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/) by [Matt Might](https://matt.might.net).

There's a story behind it (watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oud2tbtO2z8)). Here's the [blog post](https://matt.might.net/articles/my-sons-killer/). Here's a [longer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTZoJLHofBE). The story is well-known in the research community.

I hope you get it. Whatever the reason you choose to do a PhD, I hope you picked up something from this incredible story.

Every mountain is unclimbable until someone climbs it. Keep pushing.  
  
### 1.2 What is PhD Training?
Now, *qu'est-ce qu'être doctorant* (what is a PhD student)? What is it like to go through PhD training?
  
Consider this quote:
  
>[Doing a PhD] is like to be in the SAS. Once you have passed through extreme training, most normal activities are no longer stimulating [...].
>
>  Andrew Oswald, Professor of Economics & Behavioural Science, University of Warwick (cited [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/workload-survival-guide-for-academics))

You should read Oswald's part in that article, as I've quoted him out of context (he's talking about academics' heavy workload).
  
My focus is on his point that doing a PhD is like going through training in the special force--once you've passed through it, all other challenges will appear small and trivial.

I consider this an ideal outcome and what we should aim for in PhD training. Your mileage may vary. Your supervisor may think differently.

Nonetheless, good PhD training should help students develop transferable skills for their future work and life with long-term benefits. If done right, it should prepare the students for whatever comes next.

I also believe that PhD is not for the faint-hearted (if it's easy, everyone would be doing it). You need to be ready for this, and there's no goofing around. If you choose the graduate school because you don't know what to do after college, I'd suggest two options: do something else with a better financial return, or figure out what you want during your PhD (it doesn’t need to be an academic career).

You don't need to agree with me, but think about this before starting.
  
### 1.3 The Philosophy (sort of)
The philosophy of PhD training is to help students develop the mindset and the skillset to become an informed and effective lifelong learner and doer who is self-learning and self-teaching (autodidactic), self-motivated and self-starting (anti-akratic), and, above all, self-governed and self-owned (independent and free).  
  
It's a lifelong goal that may not be achieved purely through graduate training, but nonetheless a desirable outcome to aim for.  
  
### 1.4 Focus Areas
- **Skill development (hard × soft) for work and life**
- **Strong core knowledge × interdisciplinary methods**
- **Structured training × individual discovery**
- **Strategic thinking × dynamic balance**
- **Sharp focus × broad periphery views**

This section is a draft that may be revised later.

#### 1.4.1 Skill Development
- **Research & Analysis**
- **Critical, Creative, Strategic Thinking**
- **Productivity & Project Management**
- **Communication & Collaboration**
- **Digital Skills & Data Skills**
- **Qualitative & Quantitative Literacy**

Details to be added later

## 2. Before You Start

### 2.1 The Goal
There's only one goal:

- **Complete your PhD (or other graduate degrees) on time.**

'On time' should be interpreted differently and strategically depending on your field and career goal.

(a) If you want an industry job and your PhD is in a field with a matching industry to work in, you should aim to finish your PhD as fast as possible.

Set your own deadline much earlier than the standard one. Strive to achieve it. If anything went wrong and you couldn't finish your PhD earlier, you can still finish it 'on time'. If you follow the standard timeline and something went wrong, you won’t get it on time.

(b) If you want an academic job, you should utilise the maximum funded time of your PhD to build up your publication and network.

Still set your own deadline a bit earlier. If you can meet it, don't submit your PhD and give up on your funding earlier; use the 'extra time' to get more publications, then submit your PhD 'on time' when the funding ends.

Again, if anything went wrong and you couldn't finish it earlier, you can still finish it 'on time'. Be strategic.

### 2.2 Visions
The purpose of graduate research and the 'big picture':

- Push the boundary of knowledge
- Benefit people and society
- Make the world a better place

The vision is necessarily 'lofty'. Dream big. Aim high.
Then work hard (and smart) to achieve it.

### 2.3 Principles
- **Communication**
- **Strategy**
- **Execution**
- **Productivity**
- **Resilience**

### 2.4 Methods
Here's how you do it:
- Communicate, communicate, communicate
- Think strategically
- Execute effectively
- Produce more
- Adapt to changes and mistakes

**Communication:**  
If you have a question, ask. If you're unsure about something, check with your advisor. If you are falling behind the schedule, tell your advisor to work out a strategy.  

**Strategy & Execution:**  
(a) Focus on the things that will help you achieve your goal (complete the PhD on time) while developing useful skills.  
(b) Talk with your supervisor about strategy: what you should focus on, how to proceed with your research, and where to publish it.  
(c) Once you have a strategy, do it. Start now and carry on. Review and reflect regularly on both your strategy and execution. Figure out what works, what doesn't, and how to improve.  

Also check out the books in section 3.3 below.

**Productivity:**  
Productivity is essentially the ratio between the input and the output. Two ways to think about it:  
(a) More input, more output (work hard).  
(b) Less input, more output (work smart).  

The former means you are 'productive' in the sense that you are producing more research outputs, but 'more input' means you are investing lots of hours and resources to achieve it. This is necessary when you first start, need to catch up, change your area, pursue your PhD in a different country using a different language, or want to achieve more (more than required).  

The latter is to improve your productivity--in the long run, that's the only thing that matters. Less input and more output should always be the goal but may be difficult to achieve. It needs constant learning, upskilling, reflecting, testing, and polishing to improve, and it's a never-ending process.  

In reality, most people need to balance the two: work hard to produce, but always look for ways to work smart to reduce the input while maintaining or even increasing the output. Section 3.2.1 below would be helpful.  
  
**Resilience:**  
(a) Develop your ability to adapt to changes, losses, and adversities.  
(b) Learn to deal with setbacks, blunders, and downright failures and mistakes. Embrace them. That's how you learn.  
(c) Bounce back after minor and major fallouts and everything in between. They are part of life and part of your PhD.  
(d) Learn to work and perform under stress and time constraint.  
(e) Flexibility, adaptability, and perseverance are the key.  
(f) Build and improve resilience: build redundancy into the system, make back-up plans, don't put all the eggs in one basket, build multiple pillars and focus areas to support work and life, don't rely exclusively on that 'one shot' that may or may not be successful, expect and live with ups and downs, keep an open mind and a good peripheral vision, and don't get caught up in a tunnelled vision that obscures the big picture.  

The books in Sections 3.2.2 and 3.3 may be helpful.

---
**Everything here is optional. The best way to learn about writing and publication is to *read other people's work and see how they have done it, and start writing and getting your work published FROM DAY ONE if not earlier*. The books listed here can be helpful if you need some guideline.**

**Keep a razor-sharp focus on research and publication during your PhD, which is essential for an academic career. Even you choose other areas and won't end up doing academic work (see 3.6 below), it is still good to have some publication from your PhD.**

**Also, this section hasn't covered English writing styles and grammar. Non-native-speakers may want to consult relevant books (e.g. *The Elements of Style*) and attend workshops on English writing skills.**  

**I agree with Howard S. Becker that, for native-speakers, the skills required to write well are already taught in entry-level English composition classes. As Becker remarks following C. Wright Mills in *Writing for Social Scientists* (2020, pp. 5-6):**  

>Sociologists habitually use twenty words where two will do.

**Hence, for writing and revision:**  
>With my pencil poised over a word or clause, I asked, "Does this need to be here? If not, I'm taking it out." [...] I changed passive to active constructions, combined sentences, took long sentences apart—all the things [that] students might well have once learned to do in freshman composition. 
  
**Result?**  
>At the end of three hours, we had reduced four pages to three-quarters of a page without losing nuance or essential details.
  
**Think about this.**  
  
**For non-native-speakers, read good papers and books from native speakers and make your writing like theirs. Pay attention to wording and phrasing. Read broadly and don't limit your reading to your own field or only to academic materials.**  
  
**Last tip:** 

**Always talk to your supervisor about writing and publication; you need to publish *strategically*, especially if you are aiming for an academic career.** 

**Selecting journals and publishers is VERY important but rarely discussed openly and publicly, especially in HASS. Feel free to check out my collection of relevant news and discussions [here](https://github.com/John-Otago/Discussions-on-Higher-Education/blob/main/README.md#06-research-and-publication) and another project of mine [Selected Journals in HASS](https://github.com/John-Otago/Selected-Journals-in-HASS).**

### 3.6 Job Search & Career Preparation - *start from day one*

#### 3.6.1 Overview
- [Optional] **The New PhD: How to Build a Better Graduate Education** (L Cassuto & R Weisbuch, 2021, Johns Hopkins UP) || *Perhaps read the *Introduction* to understand the big picture.*
  
**Most PhD graduates (especially in HASS) will not get a career-track academic job. In a small country like ours, even those who can often spend 2-5 years on the market before they land a job. I ask all my PhD students to consider and prepare for a dual career track (academic and non-academic) from Day One.** 

**Check out this list to understand the academic job market: https://github.com/John-Otago/Discussions-on-Higher-Education/blob/main/README.md#04-the-academic-job-market.**

**For those in the US, the Biden administration has committed to more research funding especially in STEM, which may have a flow-on effect in HASS. It is still unclear whether this will lead to another 'research boom' similar to that during the Cold War when the US invested heavily in science and technology that boosted funding for universities. It is also unclear whether this will change the academic job market.**

**Last note: networking is important for both academic and non-academic careers!**  
  
#### 3.6.2 Academic Careers 
- **The Academic Job Search Handbook, 5th ed.** (Vick et al., 2016, U of Pennsylvania Press)
- **The Professor Is In: The Essential Guide to Turning Your Ph.D. into a Job** (K Kelsky, 2015, Crown)  
- **Surviving Your Academic Job Hunt: Advice for Humanities PhDs, 2nd ed.** (K Hume, 2011, Palgrave)  
  
**Keep in mind that these books were written in the US, and you need to tailor the advice to your own environment.**  

**The first book offers a good overview (matter-of-factly, as if most PhD graduates can find a career-track job in today’s market). The next two demonstrate what it is like ‘out there’ on the market and how intense it can be, while offering practical advice.**  

**All three books need an update, perhaps in a few years after Covid-19 as the pandemic may have a lasting impact on the market. I do recommend that you read all these books at the *beginning* of graduate school, and revisit them (perhaps updated editions) when you are ready to look for jobs in academia.**  
  
#### 3.6.3 Non-Academic Careers
- **Leaving Academia: A Practical Guide (Skills for Scholars series)** (CL Caterine, 2020, Princeton UP)  
- **Going Alt-Ac: A Guide to Alternative Academic Careers** (KE Linder et al., 2020, Stylus Publishing)  
- **Succeeding Outside the Academy: Career Paths beyond the Humanities, Social Sciences, and STEM** (eds. J Fruscione et al., 2018, University Press of Kansas)
- **University Startups and Spin-Offs: Guide for Entrepreneurs in Academia** (M Stagars, 2015, Apress)  
- **So What Are You Going to Do with That? Finding Careers Outside Academia, 3rd ed.** (S Basalla et al., 2014, University of Chicago Press)

**Again, all written and published in the US. Students in other countries should pick up the key points and apply them to the local context.**
