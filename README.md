## Introduction

### 0.1 Purpose
This project is to help students prepare for their PhD/Graduate School. Supervisors may also find it useful.
  
Ideally you should read through the list and the books before you start graduate school, although students at any stage of their graduate training (and perhaps early-career researchers) can benefit from this project.

Many students (including me years ago) came to graduate school underprepared, and supervisors are often deprived of time and may not be able to offer more holistic training and personal development beyond research.  
  
This project aims to develop and offer a more systematic understanding of graduate studies and more holistic training of graduate students—hence reimagining what graduate education can do and can be.  
  
### 0.2 Terminology
I use 'graduate school' and 'graduate students' for consistency, or just 'PhD' as shorthand. For research supervision, I use 'advisor' and 'supervisor' interchangeably.

I use mixed terms from both the US and the UK/Commonwealth academic systems.

For instance, a book-length PhD research is called a 'dissertation' in the US, but a 'thesis' in the UK system. To add to the confusion, a shorter piece of research is called a 'thesis' in the former, but a 'dissertation' in the latter.

Plus, 'dissertation committee' is mainly a US thing, and so is the expression of 'ABD' ('all but dissertation'). These terms may be confusing if you are not in the US or not familiar with its graduate training system.

For job search, the conventions, processes, and terminology also differ in the US, the UK/Australasia, continental Europe, and other countries and territories. 'Tenure' and 'tenure-track' are used in the US (and have been borrowed by many universities elsewhere), which is equivalent to 'permanent', 'continuing', or 'confirmation-path' in some other countries. I use 'career-track' as shorthand.

Don't worry if these seem confusing. You'll get the hang of it as you progress towards your PhD (and future career if you work in academia).

### 0.3 Areas/Disciplines
This project is developed in HASS (Humanities and Social Sciences) but should also benefit students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and other fields.

I draw insights from many areas and sectors, and this project is interdisciplinary in nature (the way I intended). The so-called ‘disciplines’ and ‘boundaries’ are artificial (albeit not arbitrary). Think in systems, not in disciplines.  
  
### 0.4 Disclaimer
This project is based on my personal philosophy and shaped by my experience. Your supervisors may have different views. Always check with them.

This is an ongoing project that will take years to develop. It is time-consuming as I need to select and read a large number of books and other resources to make recommendations and keep them up to date. I also constantly re-think and re-evaluate my approaches to make changes regularly. The mental work as well as reading and writing already took me hundreds of hours before this project first went public. It will continue to take more time to build and maintain. 
  
Keep in mind that this project is to inspire new ways of thinking and explore new approaches to graduate training. I have my principles that you may not necessarily agree with, and the world keeps changing and the way we think and train students must change accordingly (we have been kicking the can down the road for too long and missed many opportunities). The Covid-19 pandemic has signalled an epochal shift and let’s take the opportunity to drive changes and innovation.  

I welcome feedback and input from students, advisors, and everyone else. This is a Project as a Service (PaaS) that I would like to keep in [perpetual beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_beta) that can be constantly tested and updated.

## 1. Philosophy of PhD Training
### 1.1 What is a PhD?
So, *qu'est-ce que le PhD* (what is the PhD)?

Check out [The Illustrated Guide to a Ph.D.](https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/) by [Matt Might](https://matt.might.net).

There's a story behind it (watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oud2tbtO2z8)). Here's the [blog post](https://matt.might.net/articles/my-sons-killer/). Here's a [longer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTZoJLHofBE). The story is well-known in the research community.

I hope you get it. Whatever the reason you choose to do a PhD, I hope you picked up something from this incredible story.

Keep pushing.  
  
### 1.2 What is PhD Training?
Now, what is it like to go through PhD training?
  
Consider this quote:
  
>[Doing a PhD] is like to be in the SAS. Once you have passed through extreme training, most normal activities are no longer stimulating [...].
>
>  Andrew Oswald, Professor of Economics & Behavioural Science, University of Warwick (cited [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/workload-survival-guide-for-academics))

You should read Oswald's part in that article, as I've quoted him out of context (he's talking about academics' heavy workload).
  
My focus is on his point that doing a PhD is like going through training in the special force--once you've passed through it, all other challenges will appear small and trivial.

I consider this an ideal outcome and what we should aim for in PhD training. Your mileage may vary. Your supervisor may think differently.

Nonetheless, good PhD training should help students develop transferable skills for their future work and life with long-term benefits. If done right, it should prepare the students for whatever comes next.

I also believe that PhD is not for the faint-hearted (if it's easy, everyone would do it). You need to be ready for this, and there's no goofing around. If you choose the graduate school because you don't know what to do after college, I'd suggest two options: do something else with a better financial return, or figure out what you want during your PhD (it doesn’t need to be an academic career).

You don't need to agree with me, but think about this before starting.
  
### 1.3 The Philosophy (sort of)
The philosophy of PhD training is to help students develop the mindset and the skillset to become informed and effective lifelong learners and doers who are self-learning and self-teaching (autodidactic), self-motivated and self-starting (anti-akratic), and, above all, self-governed and self-owned (autonomous, independent, and free).  
  
Graduate training is not the only way to achieve this goal, and this process entails lifelong development beyond formal education. Nonetheless, it is a desirable outcome to aim for while you are in graduate school.  
  
### 1.4 Focus Areas
- **Skill development (hard × soft) for work and life**
- **Strong core knowledge × interdisciplinary coverage**
- **Structured training × individual discovery**
- **Strategic thinking × dynamic balance**
- **Sharp focus × broad periphery views**

## 2. Before You Start

### 2.1 The Vision
The purpose of graduate research and the 'big picture':

- Push the boundary of knowledge
- Benefit people and society
- Make the world a better place

The vision is necessarily 'lofty'. Dream big. Aim high.  
Then work hard (and smart) every day to achieve it.  

### 2.2 The Goal
There's only one goal when you are in graduate school:

- **Complete your PhD (or other graduate degrees) on time.**

The goal is necessarily specific and 'down to earth'.  

'On time' should be interpreted strategically depending on your field and career goal.

(a) If you want an industry job, and your PhD is in a field with a matching industry to work in, you should aim to finish your PhD as fast as possible.

Set your own deadline much earlier than the standard one. Strive to achieve it. If anything went wrong and you couldn't finish your PhD earlier, you can still finish it 'on time'. If you follow the standard timeline and something went wrong, you won’t get it on time.

(b) If you want an academic job, and/or your PhD is in a field of purely intellectual knowledge without an applied industry to work in, you should utilise the maximum funded time of your PhD to build up your publication and network.  

Still set your own deadline a bit earlier. If you can meet it, don't submit your PhD and give up on your funding earlier; use the 'extra time' to get more publications, then submit your PhD 'on time' when the funding ends.

Again, if anything went wrong and you couldn't finish it earlier, you can still finish it 'on time'. Be strategic.  

### 2.3 Principles
- **Communication**
- **Strategy**
- **Execution**
- **Productivity**
- **Resilience**

### 2.4 Methods
Here's how you do it:
- Communicate, communicate, communicate
- Think strategically
- Execute effectively
- Work productively
- Adapt to changes and mistakes

**Communication:**  
If you have a question, ask. If you're unsure about anything, check with your advisor. If you are falling behind the schedule, tell your advisor to work out a strategy.  
  
**Strategy & Execution:**  
(a) Focus on the things that will help you achieve your goal (complete the PhD on time) while developing useful skills.  
(b) Talk with your supervisor about strategy: what you should focus on, how to proceed with your research, and where to publish it.  
(c) Once you have a strategy, do it. Start now and carry on. Review and reflect regularly on both your strategy and execution. Figure out what works, what doesn't, and how to improve it.  
  
**Productivity:**  
Productivity is essentially the ratio between the input and the output. Two ways to think about it:  
(a) More input, more output (work hard).  
(b) Less input, more output (work smart).  

The former means you are 'productive' in the sense that you are producing more research outputs, but 'more input' means you are investing lots of hours and resources to achieve it. This is necessary when you first start, need to catch up, change your area, pursue your PhD in a different country using a different language, or simply want to achieve more (more than required).  

The latter is to improve your productivity--in the long run, that's the only thing that matters. Less input and more output should always be the goal but may be difficult to achieve. It needs constant learning, upskilling, reflecting, testing, and polishing to improve, and it's a never-ending process.  

In reality, most people need to balance the two: work hard to produce, but always look for ways to work smart to reduce the input while maintaining or even increasing the output. 
  
**Resilience:**  
(a) Develop your ability to adapt to changes, losses, and adversities.  
(b) Learn to deal with setbacks, blunders, and downright failures and mistakes. Embrace them. That's how you learn.  
(c) Bounce back after minor and major fallouts (and everything in between). They are part of life and part of your PhD.  
(d) Learn to work and perform under stress and time constraint.  
(e) Flexibility, adaptability, and perseverance are the key.  
(f) Build and improve resilience: build redundancy into the system, make back-up plans, don't put all the eggs in one basket, build multiple pillars to support work and life, expect and live with ups and downs, don't rely exclusively on that 'one shot' that may or may not work, keep an open mind and a good peripheral vision, and don't get caught up in a tunnelled vision that obscures the big picture.

## 3. Starting Graduate School

### 3.1 Getting Ready for Your PhD 
- **The Craft of Research, 4th ed.** (WC Booth et al., 2016, University of Chicago Press) || *An excellent introduction to the art and craft of research.*
- **How To Get A PhD: A Handbook for Students and Their Supervisors, 6th ed.** (EM Phillips & DS Pugh, 2015, Open UP) || *This is the so-called 'PhD bible' in the UK and helpful for students in many other countries. For those in North America, see the next book below.*

**Read these books, ideally before graduate school.**

### 3.2 Career Preparation - *start from day one*

#### 3.2.1 Overview
- [Optional] **The New PhD: How to Build a Better Graduate Education** (L Cassuto & R Weisbuch, 2021, Johns Hopkins UP) || *Perhaps read the *Introduction* to understand the big picture.*
  
**Most PhD graduates (especially in HASS) will not get a career-track academic job. In a small country like ours, even those who can often spend 2-5 years on the market before they land a job. I ask all my PhD students to consider and prepare for a dual career track (academic and non-academic) from Day One.** 

**Check out this list to understand the academic job market: https://github.com/John-Otago/Discussions-on-Higher-Education/blob/main/README.md#04-the-academic-job-market.**

**For those in the US, the Biden administration has committed to more research funding especially in STEM, which may have a flow-on effect in HASS. It is still unclear whether this will lead to another 'research boom' similar to that during the Cold War when the US invested heavily in science and technology that boosted funding for universities. It is also unclear whether this will change the academic job market.**

**Last note: networking is important for both academic and non-academic careers!**  
  
#### 3.2.2 Academic Careers 
- **The Academic Job Search Handbook, 5th ed.** (Vick et al., 2016, U of Pennsylvania Press)
- **The Professor Is In: The Essential Guide to Turning Your Ph.D. into a Job** (K Kelsky, 2015, Crown)  
- **Surviving Your Academic Job Hunt: Advice for Humanities PhDs, 2nd ed.** (K Hume, 2011, Palgrave)  
  
**Keep in mind that these books were written in the US, and you need to tailor the content to your own environment.**  

**The first book offers a good overview (matter-of-factly, as if most PhD graduates can find a career-track job in today’s academic market). The next two demonstrate what it is like ‘out there’ and how difficult it can be, while offering practical advice.**  

**All three books need an update, perhaps in a few years after Covid-19 as the pandemic may have a lasting impact on the market. I do recommend that you read all these books at the *beginning* of graduate school, and revisit them (perhaps updated editions) when you are ready to look for jobs in academia.**  
  
#### 3.2.3 Non-Academic Careers
- **Leaving Academia: A Practical Guide (Skills for Scholars series)** (CL Caterine, 2020, Princeton UP)  
- **Going Alt-Ac: A Guide to Alternative Academic Careers** (KE Linder et al., 2020, Stylus Publishing)  
- **Succeeding Outside the Academy: Career Paths beyond the Humanities, Social Sciences, and STEM** (eds. J Fruscione et al., 2018, University Press of Kansas)
- **University Startups and Spin-Offs: Guide for Entrepreneurs in Academia** (M Stagars, 2015, Apress)  
- **So What Are You Going to Do with That? Finding Careers Outside Academia, 3rd ed.** (S Basalla et al., 2014, University of Chicago Press)

**Again, all written and published in the US. Students in other countries should pick up the key points and apply them to the local context.**

### 3.3 Academic Writing & Publication - *start from day one*

#### 3.3.1 Writing Skills
- [Optional] **Writing for Social Scientists: How to Start and Finish Your Thesis, Book, or Article, 3rd ed.** (HS Becker, 2020, University of Chicago Press) || *It’s a nice read on ‘how to think about writing’, not a step-by-step guideline for students (see 3.5.3 if you prefer a highly structured guide).*
- [Optional] **On Revision: The Only Writing that Counts** (W Germano, 2021/pre-order, University of Chicago Press) || *I’m waiting for the release of Germano’s latest book.*
  
#### 3.3.2 The PhD Thesis/Dissertation (80,000 - 100,000 words)
- [Optional] **How to Write a Better Thesis, 3rd ed.** (D Evans et al., 2014, Springer). || *A nice little book with short chapters (easy to read). The thesis structure discussed in this book is suitable for social and behavioural sciences, but not common in the humanities and interpretive social sciences. The book also needs an update.*
- [Optional] **Helping Doctoral Students Write: Pedagogies for Supervision, 2nd ed.** (B Kamler & P Thomson, 2014, Routledge). || *The book is intended for supervisors but students can also benefit from reading it. It is suitable for those in the arts and humanities.*
  
#### 3.3.3 Journal Articles (for everyone including 'PhD by Publication')
- [Optional] **Writing Your Journal Article in Twelve Weeks: A Guide to Academic Publishing Success, 2nd ed.** (WL Belcher, 2019, University of Chicago Press). || *It's a large and heavy book (literally), helpful for beginners who prefer highly structured step-by-step instructions.*
  
#### 3.3.4 Publish your PhD as a Book (humanities & humanistic social sciences)
- [Optional] **Getting It Published: A Guide for Scholars and Anyone Else Serious about Serious Books, 3rd ed.** (W Germano, 2016, University of Chicago Press).
- [Optional] **From Dissertation to Book, 2nd ed.** (W Germano, 2016, University of Chicago Press).
  
#### 3.3.5 Blogs on Academic Writing for Graduate Students
- [Optional] [The Thesis Whisperer](https://thesiswhisperer.com/)  
- [Optional] [DoctoralWriting SIG](https://doctoralwriting.wordpress.com/) 
  
---
**Everything here is optional. The best way to learn about writing and publication is to *read other people's work and see how they have done it, and start writing and getting your work published FROM DAY ONE if not earlier*. The books listed here can be helpful if you need some guideline.**

**Keep a razor-sharp focus on research and publication during your PhD, which is essential for an academic career. Even you choose other areas and won't end up doing academic work (see 3.6 below), it is still good to have some publication from your PhD.**

**Also, this section hasn't covered English writing styles and grammar. Non-native-speakers may want to consult relevant books (e.g. *The Elements of Style*) and attend workshops on English writing skills.**  

**I agree with Howard S. Becker that, for native-speakers, the skills required to write well are already taught in entry-level English composition classes. As Becker remarks following C. Wright Mills in *Writing for Social Scientists* (2020, pp. 5-6):**  

>Sociologists habitually use twenty words where two will do.

**Hence, for writing and revision:**  
>With my pencil poised over a word or clause, I asked, "Does this need to be here? If not, I'm taking it out." [...] I changed passive to active constructions, combined sentences, took long sentences apart—all the things [that] students might well have once learned to do in freshman composition. 
  
**Result?**  
>At the end of three hours, we had reduced four pages to three-quarters of a page without losing nuance or essential details.
  
**Think about this.**  
  
**For non-native-speakers, read good papers and books from native speakers and make your writing like theirs. Pay attention to wording and phrasing. Read broadly and don't limit your reading to your own field or only to academic materials.**  
  
**Last tip:** 

**Always talk to your supervisor about writing and publication; you need to publish *strategically*, especially if you are aiming for an academic career.** 

**Selecting journals and publishers is VERY important but rarely discussed openly and publicly, especially in HASS. Check another project of mine [Selected Journals in HASS](https://github.com/John-Otago/Selected-Journals-in-HASS) as well as my collection of [relevant news and discussions](https://github.com/John-Otago/Discussions-on-Higher-Education/blob/main/README.md#06-research-and-publication).**

## 4 Work in Graduate School (and Academia)
- **A Field Guide to Grad School: Uncovering the Hidden Curriculum** (JM Calarco, 2020, Princeton UP) || *A useful book for those in the US. Students elsewhere may skim the book for key points, like how to build a team of mentors as you shouldn’t rely on one person (your supervisor) for all your mentoring needs (Chapter 2), academic jargon in the US (Chap 3), basic types and ‘politics’ of publication (8), presentations and conferences (9-10), and the job market (11).*

## 5 Essential Skills for Work & Life

### 5.1 Change how you work
- **Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World** (C Newport, 2016, Grand Central Publishing of Hachette Book Group) || *Also consult his later book *Digital Minimalism* (2019) if you find yourself distracted by social media.*
- **When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing** (DH Pink, 2018, Riverhead Books of Penguin Random House) || *Read Part One (the first two chapters); the rest is optional.*
- **Getting Things Done (GTD)®: The Art of Stress-free Productivity, updated edition** (D Allen, 2015, Penguin Book) || *GTD is a great method. The book is rich and dense; take your time to go through it and try implementing the method. You may purchase a copy and consult it from time to time. There are also many online resources devoted to GTD.*
- [Optional] **The Power of Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal** (J Loehr et al., 2003, Free Press) || *This book is all about energy management (vis-a-vis time management); you may find it useful if you frequently deal with heavy workloads and long hours, which may be typical during your PhD and in your academic life. Also search for more recent research and publications on this topic.*

**I require all my PhD students to read these books. The goal is to help you get the most out of your graduate school for a productive and fulfilling life and career, if you can implement the principles and methods described in these books (and perhaps develop your own system based on these).**
  
  
### 5.2 Change how you think
- **Thinking in Systems: A Primer** (written by DH Meadows, edited by D Wright, 2008, Chelsea Green Publishing) || *Must-read. There are other books (e.g. _The Fifth Discipline_) on similar topics. I recommend this one.*  

More books to be added later.

  
### 5.3 Change how you use digital tools
- [Optional] **The Joy of Search: A Google Insider's Guide to Going Beyond the Basics** (DM Russell, 2019, MIT Press) || *It's useful for secondary research like fact-checking and basic info gathering; Chapters 6 and 10 are particularly good.*
