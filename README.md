## Introduction

### 0.1 Purpose
This project is to help students prepare for their PhD/Graduate School. Supervisors (and potentially anyone who desires continued personal growth) may also find it useful.
  
Ideally, you should read through the list and the books before you start graduate school, although people at any stage of their graduate training and academic career can benefit from this project.

Many students (including me years ago) came to graduate school underprepared, and supervisors are often deprived of time and may not be able to offer more holistic training and personal development beyond research.  
  
Institutionally, there’s often very limited targeted training and skill development for students before their exposure to the stress in graduate school (and later in their academic career, if they can find a job). It’s like sending soldiers to the battlefield without training.  
  
This project aims to develop and offer a more systematic understanding of graduate studies and more holistic training of graduate students—hence reimagine what graduate education can do and can be.  
  
### 0.2 Terminology
I use 'graduate school' and 'graduate students' in this project, or just 'PhD' as shorthand. For research supervision, I use 'advisor' and 'supervisor' interchangeably.

I use mixed terms from both the US and the UK/Commonwealth academic systems.

For instance, a book-length PhD research is called a 'dissertation' in the US, but a 'thesis' in the UK system. To add to the confusion, a shorter piece of research is called a 'thesis' in the former, but a 'dissertation' in the latter.

Plus, 'dissertation committee' is mainly a US thing, and so is the expression of 'ABD' ('all but dissertation'). These terms may be confusing if you are not in the US or not familiar with its graduate training system.

For job search, the conventions, processes, and terminology also differ in the US, the UK/Australasia, continental Europe, and other countries and territories. 'Tenure' and 'tenure-track' are used in the US (and have been borrowed by many universities elsewhere), which is equivalent to 'permanent', 'continuing', or 'confirmation-path' in some other countries. I use 'career-track' as shorthand.

Don't worry if these terms seem confusing. You'll get the hang of them as you progress towards your PhD (and future career if you work in academia).

### 0.3 Areas/Disciplines
This project is developed in HASS (Humanities and Social Sciences) but should also benefit students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and other fields.

I draw insights from many areas and sectors, and this project is interdisciplinary in nature (the way I intended). The so-called ‘disciplines’ and ‘boundaries’ are artificial (albeit not arbitrary). Think in systems, not in disciplines.  
  
### 0.4 Disclaimer
This project is based on my personal philosophy and shaped by my experience. Your supervisors may have different views. Always check with them.

This is an ongoing project that will take years to develop. It is time-consuming as I need to select and read a large number of books and other resources to make recommendations and keep them up to date. I also constantly re-think and re-evaluate my approaches to make changes regularly. The mental work as well as reading and writing already took ~~hundreds~~ thousands of hours before this project first went public. It will take more time to update and maintain. 
  
Keep in mind that this project is to inspire new ways of thinking and explore new approaches to graduate training. I have my principles that you may not necessarily agree with, and the world keeps changing and the way we think and train students must change accordingly. We have been kicking the can down the road for too long and missed many opportunities (see e.g. my collection of relevant discussions [here](https://github.com/John-Otago/Discussions-on-Higher-Education/blob/main/README.md#08-relevant-books)—there are many other books and commentaries published on this topic). The Covid-19 pandemic has signalled an epochal shift and let’s take the opportunity to drive changes and innovation.  

I welcome feedback and input from students, advisors, and everyone else. This is a Project as a Service (PaaS) that I would like to keep in [perpetual beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_beta) that can be constantly tested and updated.

## 1. Philosophy of PhD Training
  
### 1.1 What is a PhD?
So, *qu'est-ce que le PhD* (what is the PhD)?

Check out [The Illustrated Guide to a Ph.D.](https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/) by [Matt Might](https://matt.might.net).

There's a story behind it (watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oud2tbtO2z8); here's the [blog post](https://matt.might.net/articles/my-sons-killer/); and here's a [longer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTZoJLHofBE)). The story is well-known in the research community.

I hope you get it. Whatever the reason you choose to do a PhD, I hope you picked up something from this incredible story.

Keep pushing.  
  
### 1.2 Why Do You Want a PhD?
If your supervisor hasn’t asked you why you choose graduate school, you should ask yourself before you start and have a *really* clear answer, rather than a vague impression that this is something you ‘should’ do or ‘like’ to do.
  
There are probably many other things that you should do or would enjoy doing, but why a PhD—a multiyear commitment and hard work with great risks and opportunity cost?
  
I raise this question, not to be cynical or discourage you from graduate school, but to ask you to think *clearly* and *strategically* about why you want a PhD, where and when you should do your PhD, in which discipline(s), at what cost, and with what kind of possible outcomes. This is potentially a life-changing decision, for better or for worse, and you should take it seriously for an informed decision that aligns with reality.  
  
I’ve seen so many PhD graduates end up jobless after graduate school and have to collect unemployment benefits, or only find work in sales, retail, restaurants, supermarkets, or drive cabs (all real-life examples)—it’s not that these jobs are ‘below’ anyone, but that our PhD graduates are competing with high school dropouts for these jobs that don’t need a college degree. International students may not even be allowed to stay in the country if they don’t have a job that matches their PhD once their visa runs out. Some degree-holders may find themselves essentially unemployable or severely under-employed, especially if they did their PhD in a non-applied area, although this problem can occur to any PhD in any discipline. 
  
As I show in this project, PhD training, if done right, offers great benefits—but you need to be prepared and forget your naive views and wishful thinking that don't align with reality.
  
As a bare minimum, think about the trade-off between the cost and the potential benefit, and possible risks and outcomes, before you start graduate school. Some of the resources below will help you (see also [Appendix A](https://github.com/John-Otago/PhD-Plus/blob/main/README.md#appendix-a)). At least, you should be able to clearly answer the question ‘why do you want to do a PhD’ and have a Plan B (and keep working towards it) in case your PhD doesn’t work out or doesn’t lead to the outcome you anticipated, which seems to be the case for many (under-prepared) PhDs.
  
Keep in mind that ‘enjoying it’ (a hobby) or ‘good at it’ (a skill) alone shouldn’t justify doing research at graduate school as your full-time job (a career) or what you do with your life (a future). You should take other more practical issues into account, like *whether you should pursue something else that you will also ace and enjoy*, *whether you can support yourself after graduate school without a job*, and *what if your PhD only leads to a career that doesn’t need graduate degrees*. That’s a necessary process before you make this major and life-changing investment called a PhD.
  
### 1.3 What is PhD Training?
Now, what is it like to go through PhD training?
  
Consider this quote:
  
>[Doing a PhD] is like to be in the SAS. Once you have passed through extreme training, most normal activities are no longer stimulating [...].
>
>  -- Andrew Oswald, Professor of Economics & Behavioural Science, University of Warwick (cited [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/workload-survival-guide-for-academics))

You should read Oswald's part in that article, as I've quoted him out of context (he's talking about academics' heavy workload).
  
My focus is on his point that doing a PhD is like going through training in the special force--once you've passed through it, all other challenges will appear small and trivial.

I consider this an ideal outcome and what we should aim for in PhD training. Your mileage may vary. Your supervisor may think differently.

Nonetheless, good PhD training should help students develop transferable skills for their future work and life with long-term benefits. If done right, it should prepare the students for whatever comes next.

I also believe that the PhD is not for the faint-hearted (if it's easy, everyone would do it). You need to be ready for this, and there's no goofing around. If you choose the graduate school because you don't know what to do after college, I'd suggest two options: do something else with a better financial return, or figure out what you want during your PhD (it doesn’t need to be an academic career).

You don't need to agree with me, but think about this before starting.  
  
I know I might have been glorifying graduate school—it’s definitely not all rosy—but if you *really* want to do a PhD, I hope you can get the most out of it.
  
### 1.4 The Philosophy (sort of)
The philosophy of PhD training is to help students develop the mindset and the skillset to become informed and effective lifelong learners and doers who are self-learning and self-teaching (autodidactic), self-motivated and self-starting (anti-akratic), and, above all, self-governed and self-owned (autonomous, independent, and free).  
  
Freedom is the ultimate goal. Freedom is never free—it can only be achieved through careful thinking, doing, tinkering, and risk-taking. It is hard work, and graduate school offers a good training opportunity.  

Graduate training is not the only way to achieve this goal, and this process entails lifelong development beyond formal education. Nonetheless, it is a desirable outcome to aim for.

## 2. Before You Start
  
### 2.1 The Vision
The purpose of graduate research and the 'big picture':

- Push the boundary of knowledge
- Benefit people and society
- Make the world a better place

The vision is necessarily 'lofty'. Dream big. Aim high.  
Then work hard (and smart) to achieve it.  

### 2.2 The Goal
There's only one goal when you are in graduate school:

- **Complete your PhD (or other graduate degrees) on time.**

The goal is necessarily specific and 'down to earth'.  
  
#### 'On time' should be interpreted strategically depending on your field and career goal.

(a) If you want an industry job, and your PhD is in a field with a matching industry to work in, you should aim to finish your PhD as fast as possible.

Set your own deadline much earlier than the standard one. Strive to achieve it. If anything went wrong and you couldn't finish your PhD earlier, you can still finish it 'on time'. If you follow the standard timeline and something went wrong, you won’t get it on time.

(b) If you want an academic job, or your PhD is in a field of purely intellectual inquiry without an applied industry to work in, you should utilise the maximum funded time of your PhD to build up your publication and network.  

Still set your own deadline a bit earlier. If you can finish your PhD earlier, don't submit your PhD and give up on your funding; use the 'extra time' to get more publications, then submit your PhD 'on time' when the funding ends. I learnt this the hard way.

Again, if anything went wrong and you couldn't finish it earlier, you can still finish it 'on time'. Be strategic.  
  
#### This strategy serves a purpose. Think about the following two scenarios, and which one you’d like to be in:  
  
- Always one step ahead (busy but relaxed)
- Always one step behind (busy *and* stressed)

You’d be happier during your PhD if you can keep a sense of relaxed control by being one step ahead (or more). You will be stressed if you are often behind or find yourself in a rush to *just* meet the deadline.

Some books I recommend below (Sections 3-7) can help you better understand and carry out this strategy to achieve this goal.
  
### 2.3 Principles
- **Communication**
- **Strategy**
- **Execution**
- **Sustained Productivity**
- **Resilience**

### 2.4 Methods
Here's how you do it:
- Communicate, communicate, communicate
- Think strategically
- Execute effectively
- Work productively
- Adapt to changes and mistakes

**Communication:**  
If you have a question, ask. If you're unsure about anything, check with your advisor. If you are falling behind, tell your advisor and work out a strategy.  
  
**Strategy & Execution:**  
(a) Focus on the things that will help you achieve your goal (complete the PhD on time) while developing useful skills.  
(b) Talk with your supervisor about strategy: what you should focus on, how to proceed with your research, and where to publish it.  
(c) Once you have a strategy, do it. Start now and carry on. Review and reflect regularly on both your strategy and execution. Figure out what works, what doesn't, and how to improve it.  
  
**Productivity:**  
Productivity is essentially the ratio between the input and the output. Two ways to think about it:  
  
(a) More input, more output (work hard).  
(b) Less input, more output (work smart).  

The former means you are 'productive' in the sense that you are producing more research outputs, but 'more input' means you are investing lots of time and resources to achieve it. This is necessary when you first start, need to catch up, change your area, pursue your PhD in a different country using a different language, or simply want to achieve more (more than required).  

The latter is to improve your productivity--in the long run, that's the only thing that matters. Less input and more output should always be the goal but may be difficult to achieve. It needs constant learning, upskilling, reflecting, testing, and polishing to improve, and it's a never-ending process.  

In reality, most people need to balance the two: work hard to produce, but always look for ways to work smart to reduce the input while maintaining or even increasing the output. 
  
Above all, make your productivity sustainable - see Section 7.4 below.  
  
**Resilience:**  
(a) Develop your ability to adapt to changes, losses, and adversities.  
(b) Learn to deal with setbacks, blunders, and downright failures and mistakes. Embrace them. That's how you learn.  
(c) Bounce back after minor and major fallouts (and everything in between). They are part of life and part of your PhD.  
(d) Learn to work and perform under stress and time constraint.  
(e) Flexibility, adaptability, and perseverance are the key.  
(f) Build and improve resilience: build redundancy into the system, make back-up plans, don't put all the eggs in one basket, build multiple pillars to support work and life, expect and live with ups and downs, don't rely exclusively on that 'one shot' that may or may not work, keep an open mind and a good peripheral vision, and don't get caught up in a tunnelled vision that obscures the big picture.  
  
Sections 6-7 will be helpful.

### 4. Career Preparation - *start from day one*
  
### 4.1 Overview
It comes as a rude awakening for some PhD students that most of them will never get a career-track academic job (especially in HASS). That includes many good PhD graduates with a track record of publication and excellent teaching experience. The academic job market follows the simple rule of supply and demand (over-supply and weak/declining demand). No matter how good you are, there are simply too many candidates on the market. Ignoring this rule will cost you dearly. Make plans when you start graduate school, not when you finish.  
  
Check out this list to understand the (mostly collapsed) academic job market: https://github.com/John-Otago/Discussions-on-Higher-Education/blob/main/README.md#04-the-academic-job-market.  
  
If you come from a typical middle-class family or from a culture that highly values education, you may 'naturally' believe that more education will lead to more opportunities--that's not necessarily true.  
  
In a small country, even those who can land a career-track academic job often spend 2-5 years on the market (again, many good and more experienced candidates are waiting ahead of you). In a large country, you have to be both good and lucky. The same rule applies to post-docs.  
  
International students should also think about in which country they are going to do their PhD: a doctorate in a leading country at the top of the academic hierarchy may earn you the entry ticket to global mobility and allow you to consider jobs in most countries you are willing to work in; the reverse is unlikely to be true (i.e. a PhD earned in a country with less academic prowess may confine your career to the local market, as the bigger players often prefer their own graduates trained in their own systems).  
  
For those in the US, the Biden administration has committed to more research funding especially in STEM, which may have a flow-on effect in HASS. It is still unclear whether this will lead to another 'research boom' similar to that during the Cold War when the US invested heavily in science and technology that boosted funding for universities. It is also unclear whether this will change the academic job market.  

Overall, I ask all my PhD students to consider and prepare for a dual career track (academic and non-academic) from Day One.  
  
### 4.2 Academic Careers 
- **The Academic Job Search Handbook, 5th ed.** (JM Vick et al., 2016, U of Pennsylvania Press)
- **The Professor Is In: The Essential Guide to Turning Your Ph.D. into a Job** (K Kelsky, 2015, Crown)
- **Surviving Your Academic Job Hunt: Advice for Humanities PhDs, 2nd ed.** (K Hume, 2011, Palgrave)  
  
Keep in mind that these books were written in the US, and you need to tailor the content to your own environment.  

The first book offers a good overview (matter-of-factly, as if most PhD graduates can find a career-track job in today’s academic market). The next two tell you what it's really like ‘out there’ and how difficult it can be, while offering practical advice.  

All three books need an update, perhaps in a few years after Covid-19 as the pandemic may have a lasting impact on the market. I do recommend that you read all these books at the *beginning* of graduate school, and revisit them (perhaps updated editions) when you are ready to look for jobs in academia.  
  
### 4.3 Non-Academic Careers
- **Leaving Academia: A Practical Guide (*Skills for Scholars* series)** (CL Caterine, 2020, Princeton UP)
- **Going Alt-Ac: A Guide to Alternative Academic Careers** (KE Linder et al., 2020, Stylus Publishing)
- **Succeeding Outside the Academy: Career Paths beyond the Humanities, Social Sciences, and STEM** (eds. J Fruscione & KJ Baker, 2018, University Press of Kansas)
- **So What Are You Going to Do with That? Finding Careers Outside Academia, 3rd ed.** (S Basalla & M Debelius, 2014, University of Chicago Press)

- [**MyIDP**](https://myidp.sciencecareers.org/) (web service for STEM PhDs)
- [**ImaginePhD**](https://www.imaginephd.com/) (web service for HASS PhDs)

Again, all from the US. Students in other countries should pick up the key points and apply them to the local context.  
  
### 4.4 University Startups & Innovation-Driven Entrepreneurship
- [Optional] **The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses** (E Ries, 2011, Currency)
- [Optional] **Research to Revenue: A Practical Guide to University Start-Ups** (D Rose & C Patterson, 2016, University of North Carolina Press)
- [Optional] MIT open course (15.390) and MOOC (15.390x) on **Innovation-Driven Entrepreneurship** || *You can find it on [EdX]( https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/online-learning/), YouTube ([here]( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCalob7RKVi8MsKjMmpiyZzw) and [here]( https://www.youtube.com/MITBootcamps)), or [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-390-new-enterprises-spring-2013/). You can also sign up for their [bootcamp](https://bootcamps.mit.edu/bootcamps/innovation-leadership/).*

### 4.5 Become an SME Owner-Operator or Sole-Proprietor
- [No book recommended in this section.]

Starting and running a small business (SME: small-or-medium-sized enterprise) is different from launching an innovation-driven startup. 

You'll see in the books on non-academic careers that some PhD graduates (especially in HASS) have launched their consultancy or writing/editing services, and essentially become owner-operators of small businesses (or sole-traders/proprietors).  
  
Whether to run a startup or a small business, practice is much more important than theory. Your local small business council or association may be able to help, and there are lots of relevant resources online. You need to learn from people with real-life business experiences, not academics who write books for other academics. If you do read books, choose those written by experienced business people.  
  
Last note: networking is important for both academic and non-academic careers!

### 5. Academic Writing & Publication - *start from day one*
  
### 5.1 Writing Skills
- [Optional] **Writing for Social Scientists: How to Start and Finish Your Thesis, Book, or Article, 3rd ed.** (HS Becker, 2020, University of Chicago Press) || *It’s a nice read on ‘how to think about writing’, not a step-by-step guideline for students (see 5.3 if you prefer a highly structured guide).*
  
- [Optional] **On Revision: The Only Writing that Counts** (W Germano, 2021, University of Chicago Press) || *An interesting little book, completely optional.*
  
### 5.2 The PhD Thesis/Dissertation
- [Optional] **How to Write a Better Thesis, 3rd ed.** (D Evans et al., 2014, Springer). || *A nice little book with short chapters (easy to read). The thesis structure discussed in this book is suitable for social and behavioural sciences, but not common in the humanities and interpretive social sciences. The book also needs an update.*
  
- [Optional] **Helping Doctoral Students Write: Pedagogies for Supervision, 2nd ed.** (B Kamler & P Thomson, 2014, Routledge). || *The book is intended for supervisors but students can also benefit from it. It is suitable for those in the arts and humanities.*
  
### 5.3 Journal Articles
- [Optional] **Writing Your Journal Article in Twelve Weeks: A Guide to Academic Publishing Success, 2nd ed.** (WL Belcher, 2019, University of Chicago Press). || *It's a large and heavy book (literally), helpful for beginners who prefer highly structured step-by-step instructions.*  
  
- [Optional] **The Savvy Academic: Publishing in the Social and Health Sciences** (SJ Schwartz, 2022, Oxford UP). || *Can be useful for those in social and behavioural sciences.*  
  
### 5.4 Publish your PhD as a Book (humanities & humanistic social sciences)
- [Optional] **Getting It Published: A Guide for Scholars and Anyone Else Serious about Serious Books, 3rd ed.** (W Germano, 2016, University of Chicago Press).
- [Optional] **From Dissertation to Book, 2nd ed.** (W Germano, 2016, University of Chicago Press).
- [Optional] **The Book Proposal Book: A Guide for Scholarly Authors** (L Portwood-Stacer, 2021, Princeton UP).
  
### 5.5 Blogs on Academic Writing
- [Optional] [The Thesis Whisperer](https://thesiswhisperer.com/)  
- [Optional] [DoctoralWriting SIG](https://doctoralwriting.wordpress.com/)
  
---
Everything here is optional. The best way to learn about writing and publication is to *read other people's work and see how they have done it, and start writing and getting your work published FROM DAY ONE if not earlier*. The books listed here can be helpful if you need some guidelines.  
  
Keep a razor-sharp focus on research and publication if you want an academic career. Even if you won't end up doing academic work, it is still good to have publications during your PhD.  
  
Also, this section hasn't covered English writing styles and grammar. You may consult relevant books (e.g. *The Elements of Style*) and attend workshops on writing skills.  
  
I agree with Howard Becker that, for native-speakers, the skills required to write well are already taught in entry-level composition classes. Becker has shared the following example in *Writing for Social Scientists* (2020, pp. 5-6):  
  
>Sociologists habitually use twenty words where two will do.
  
To reduce wordiness:  
>With my pencil poised over a word or clause, I asked, "Does this need to be here? If not, I'm taking it out." [...] I changed passive to active constructions, combined sentences, took long sentences apart—all the things [that] students might well have once learned to do in freshman composition. 
  
Result?  
>At the end of three hours, we had reduced four pages to three-quarters of a page without losing nuance or essential details.
  
Think about it.  
  
Another rule of thumb: read good papers/books and consciously adopt good wording and phrasing in your own writing. Read broadly and don't limit your reading to your own field or only to academic literature.  
  
Last tip:  
  
Always talk to your supervisor about writing and publication; you need to publish *strategically*, especially if you are aiming for an academic career.  
  
Selecting journals and publishers is VERY important but rarely discussed openly and publicly, especially in HASS. Check another project of mine [Selected Journals in HASS](https://github.com/John-Otago/Selected-Journals-in-HASS) as well as my collection of [relevant news reports and discussions](https://github.com/John-Otago/Discussions-on-Higher-Education/blob/main/README.md#06-research-and-publication).

## 6. Become Self-Owned
  
### 6.1 Change How You Think
- **Thinking in Systems: A Primer** (written by DH Meadows, edited by D Wright, 2008, Chelsea Green Publishing) || *Start from this one before you proceed to other books on systems thinking (e.g. **The Fifth Discipline**).*
  
- **Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know** (A Grant, 2021, Viking) || *Read the whole book.*
  
- **Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much** (S Mullainathan & E Shafir, 2013, Times Books) || *Read Chapters 1-2 and 6, and perhaps skim through 7-10.*
  
- **Incerto** (NN Taleb, 2019/2021, Random House) || *This is a collection of five books. Read them all, or at least **Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder** (2012/2014). You don’t need to agree with the author on everything, but take in the key points.*
  
Read them all.  
  
### 6.2 Change How You Work
- **Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World** (C Newport, 2016, Grand Central Publishing of Hachette Book Group) || *Also consult his later book *Digital Minimalism* (2019) if you find yourself distracted by social media.*
  
- **Getting Things Done (GTD)®: The Art of Stress-free Productivity, updated edition** (D Allen, 2015, Penguin Book) || *GTD is a great method. The book is rich and dense; take your time to go through it and try implementing the method. You may purchase a copy and consult it from time to time. The author has two other books, **Ready for Everything** and **Making It All Work**, and parts of them may be helpful.*
  
- **Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much** (S Mullainathan & E Shafir, 2013, Times Books) || *It’s included here again because it has implications on how we work and is relevant to the two books on time/energy management below*.
  
- **When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing** (DH Pink, 2018, Riverhead Books of Penguin Random House) || *Read Part One (the first two chapters); the rest is optional.*
  
- **The Power of Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal** (J Loehr & T Schwartz, 2003, Free Press) || *This book is about energy management (vis-à-vis time management); you'll find it useful if you frequently deal with heavy workloads and long hours, which may be typical during your PhD and academic life.*  
  
- **Two Awesome Hours: Science-Based Strategies to Harness Your Best Time and Get Your Most Important Work Done** (J Davis, 2015/2017, HarperOne) || *I find the first strategy quite useful, and perhaps the next two. The rest are very common and you probably have picked them up elsewhere.*  
  
You should read these books. The goal is to help you get the most of graduate school for a productive and fulfilling life and career, if you can implement the principles and methods described in these books (and perhaps develop your own system based on these).
  
### 6.3 Change How You Communicate
- **How to Get Your Point Across in 30 Seconds or Less** (MO Frank, 1986/1990, Simon & Schuster) || *It’s an old book that may still be useful if you can find a copy.*
  
- **Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High, 3rd ed.** (J Grenny et al., 2021, McGraw Hill) || *Frankly I don't think the book is well-written, but the method described here can be quite helpful.*
  
These books can help improve your communication skills in everyday life and in your career. You may also consult other titles and resources on this topic.  
  
### 6.4 Change Your Habits  
- **The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business** (C Duhigg, 2012/2014, Random House) || *Read Part One (Chapters 1-3) and the first half of Part Two (Chapters 4-5).*
  
- [Optional] **Atomic Habits** (J Clear, 2018, Random House) || *Completely optional. The first book is better (I revisited my notes six months later and still reached the same conclusion).*  

These books can help you cultivate good habits and break bad ones, especially when you find yourself struggling to break a 'vicious cycle' or to build a 'virtuous' habit. It is a useful skill for both your PhD and your future life and career.
   
### 6.5 Change How You Build Resilience
- **Your Survival Instinct Is Killing You: Retrain Your Brain to Conquer Fear and Build Resilience** (M Schoen with K Loberg, 2014, Plume) || *A very insightful book. Highly recommended.*
  
- **Do Hard Things: Why We Get Resilience Wrong and the Surprising Science of Real Toughness** (S Magness, 2022, HarperOne) || *Exceptional. Read the whole thing. See also Section 7.4 below.*  
  
- [Optional] **Emotional Agility: Get Unstuck, Embrace Change, and Thrive in Work and Life** (S David, 2016, Avery, of Penguin Random House) || *I find Chapter 6 enlightening; you can consult other chapters if you find them useful.*
  
- [Optional] **The Worry Solution: Using Your Healing Mind to Turn Stress and Anxiety into Better Health and Happiness** (M Rossman, 2010, Harmony) || *May be helpful.*
  
- [Optional] **Happier: Learn the Secrets to Daily Joy and Lasting Fulfillment** (T Ben-Shahar, 2007, McGraw Hill) || *Perhaps a bit too basic overall, but may still be helpful (e.g. Chapters 2 & 3).*
  
### 6.6 Change How You Use Digital Tools
- Note-taking: try the new generation of note-taking tools that have emerged since 2020: [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), or [RemNote](https://www.remnote.com/). You can find lots of online tutorials (e.g. videos and blog posts) on how to use them. Do your research and choose your favourite one :)
  
- [Optional] **The Joy of Search: A Google Insider's Guide to Going Beyond the Basics** (DM Russell, 2019, MIT Press) || *It's useful for secondary research like fact-checking and basic info gathering; Chapters 6 and 10 are particularly good.*

## 7. Become Self-Owned (continued)
  
### 7.1 Principles & Disciplines  
 
- **Incerto** (NN Taleb, 2019/2021, Random House) || *You’ve read **Antifragile** as mentioned in 6.1? Good. Now go and read the rest of the collection. Again, you don't need to agree with the author on everything, but think about what he said.*  
  
- **Principles: Life & Work** (R Dalio, 2017, Simon & Schuster) || *You may find this book a bit too long and only partially useful, but read it anyway. It's followed by two more books by the same author if you are interested.*  
  
- **Great by Choice: Uncertainty, Chaos, and Luck--Why Some Thrive Despite Them All** (J Collins & MT Hansen, 2011, Harper Collins) || *Read it if you haven't. Also consult other books by Jim Collins.*  
  
- **The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, 30th-anniversary edition.** (SR Covey, [1989] 2020, Free Press, of Simon & Schuster) || *Presumably most people have read this old classic. It's not the best book out there, but do read it if you haven't.*  
  
Principles and disciplines are foundations of personal mastery and freedom. They support how you think and act. They keep you going in good times and bad. They guide you through difficulties and uncertainties. This section is the prerequisite for what comes below.  
  
  
### 7.2 Strategy & Execution
#### Strategy
- **On Grand Strategy** (JL Gaddis, 2018/2019, Penguin Books) || *Read the whole thing.*
- **How to Think Strategically: Sharpen Your Mind, Develop Your Competency, Contribute to Success** (G Githens, 2019/2020, Maven House)
- **Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...and Others Don't** (J Collins, 2001, Harper Collins)
- **Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less** (G McKeown, 2014/2020, Currency/Crown)

#### Execution
- **Effortless: Make it Easier to Do What Matters Most** (G McKeown, 2021, Currency/Virgin Books)
- **The 4 Disciplines of Execution: Achieving Your Wildly Important Goals, 2nd ed.** (C McChesney et al., 2021, Simon & Schuster)
- [Optional] **The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of the Learning Organization** (PM Senge, [1990] 2006, Doubleday) || *Completely optional if you have read **Thinking in Systems**. Or perhaps read only Part I & II (first seven chapters).
  
It's difficult to find a good book on generic strategic thinking. Strategy is mostly discussed in the military, foreign policy, and business administration. Few people talk about how it functions in everyday life.  

In fact, many people already engage strategic thinking on a day-to-day basis from planning to decision-making, although most people are not conscious that what they do is ‘strategy’.  

I truly believe that strategic thinking is essential to help people think, plan, and realise their goals and potential. Strategy is what gets you from here to where you want to be in the most efficient way. It's crucial when you make decisions and long-term plans.  
  
Anyway, at the end of the day, *a good night's sleep* may be the best strategy of all :)  
  
  
### 7.3 Decision-Making & Problem-Solving
#### Decision-Making
- **Decisive: How to Make Better Choices in Life and Work** (UK version: **Decisive: How to Make Better Decisions**) (C Heath & D Heath, 2013, Currency) || *Highly recommended. Part I (Chapters 2-4) is particularly good. If you only read one book on decision-making, this should be the one.*
- **How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices** (A Duke, 2020, Portfolio) || *A nice summary of relevant tools that complements the book above. You may also consult her earlier book **Thinking in Bets** (2018/2019, perhaps only the first chapter).*
- [Optional] **Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment** (D Kahneman et al., 2021, Little, Brown Spark)
  
#### Problem-Solving
- **Nudge: The Final Edition** (RH Thaler & CR Sunstein, 2021, Penguin Books) || *Read it if you haven’t heard about ‘nudge’.*
- [Optional] **Change: Principles of Problem Formation and Problem Resolution** (P Watzlawick et al., [1974] 2011, W. W. Norton & Company)  || *Completely optional.*
- Many other books above have also covered decision-making and problem-solving.

Goal-setting, decision-making, problem-solving, and risk-taking are important and integral to our work and life. Read widely on these topics so you'll see the connections, but keep in mind that practice is always more important than theoretical knowledge on paper.  
   
   
### 7.4 Sustained Passion, Performance, and Productivity
- **The Power of Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal** (J Loehr & T Schwartz, 2003, Free Press) || *I’ve already recommended this book. It covers both practical issues and important underlying principles to help us organise our life and work.*  
- **Peak Performance: Elevate Your Game, Avoid Burnout, and Thrive with the New Science of Success** (B Stulberg & S Magness, 2017, Rodale) || *Read Section 1.*  
- **The Passion Paradox: A Guide to Going All In, Finding Success, and Discovering the Benefits of an Unbalanced Life** (B Stulberg & S Magness, 2019, Rodale) || Read the whole thing. This book gives very insightful and practical advice on how to develop a growth mindset, which is super important in life and work towards freedom and self-mastery.  
- **Do Hard Things: Why We Get Resilience Wrong and the Surprising Science of Real Toughness** (S Magness, 2022, HarperOne) || *Already recommended above. This is one of the most important books on the list that ties a lot of things together. Everyone should read it.*  

This section is a follow-up to 6.2 Change How Your Work and 6.5 Change How You Build Resilience. **Productivity** is super important for both individuals (personal growth and life-long learning) and society (development and prosperity), and so are sustained passion and performance. **Sustainability** is the key – unsustainable productivity is not truly productive in the long run. Read all the books in this section.  
  
  
### 7.5 The Overlooked & Undervalued   
- Books to be added later.  
  
There are things that they won’t teach and you won’t learn in graduate school, and there are unorthodox approaches that conventional academics may frown upon.  
  
This kind of omission will create blind spots that you'll miss, especially those things that are important in real life but rarely discussed in the ivory tower.  
  
I will add a few books and relevant resources to this section.

## Closing Remarks
  
### Walk the Talk
Congratulations that you have come this far and read through the whole project. I hope you have thought about the issues I have raised, read the books I suggested above, and made connections between everything you have read, learnt, and thought about.  
  
Now what?  
  
Well, you have to put everything to the test. An untested theory is merely a theory, and untested knowledge may not work in practice. There’s always a gap (or a creative tension) between theory and practice, and you have to connect them.  
  
You have to ‘walk the talk’, so to speak, to test what you have learnt: what works, what doesn’t, how to improve it, and how to make it work *for you*.  
  
In other words, you need to turn your theoretical knowledge into productive practice for continued learning and tinkering towards personal mastery and self-governance. That’s the philosophy behind this whole project.  
  
Face the truth. Confront the facts. Embrace reality.  
  
### *Via Negativa*
Here, *via negativa* means learning and doing by subtraction, by strategically doing less but focusing more, and by detecting and extracting what is useful from what is not, the most essential from the less important, and the mission-critical from the trivial and the marginal.  
  
To concentrate on the most important tasks, you have to ignore the less important ones. To seek truth and useful knowledge, you have to identify and eliminate falsehoods and theories that won’t stand real-life tests. To keep what works, you have to get rid of what doesn’t. To ask the right question and find the right problem, you have to remove the false and superficial ones.  
  
Sometimes the more you do, the less you actually accomplish. You should *remove* more instead of doing more. Lots of things are practically worthless.  
  
Only when you reduce and eliminate noises, distractions, falsehoods, and the nonessentials, will the most crucial and the most critical emerge.  
  
In terms of **learning**, once you have *built up* your reservoir of knowledge, you’ll need to *build down* and trim off excessive and obsolete knowledge that doesn’t work or no longer aligns with reality. Only keep what is true and what works for you, so you can reduce the vast reservoir of knowledge to concentrated essences.  
  
In terms of **doing**, less is more. By doing less and only the most crucial, you can keep a sharp focus, align your efforts with what matters most, and direct your attention and energy to your wildly important goal. ‘Doing less’ while ‘focusing more’ is the most effective and productive way to achieve what you aim for.  

In other words, you need to align your resources, efforts, and capabilities with your intentions and aspirations. Respect constraints.  
  
The most useful can be the most concise. The most essential can be the simplest of all.  
  
Be a hedgehog who knows and does one thing right; don’t be a fox who knows many things that don’t really work.  
  
At the end of the day, what you don’t know (the *anti-knowledge*) may be more important than what you know. The books you haven’t read (the *anti-library*) may be more important than those you have.  
  
Keep that in mind.  
  
### The End is the Start
The end of theory is the start of practice (and vice versa). The end of reading and learning is the start of doing. The end of building up is the start of building down and cutting off.  
  
The end of this project is the start of how you understand, approach, prepare for, and make the most of your graduate training, and the end of graduate school is the start of your real-life adventures.  
  
Let’s once again go back to the beginning and take another look at the philosophy behind PhD training:  
  
>The philosophy is to help students develop the mindset and the skillset to become informed and effective lifelong learners and doers who are self-learning and self-teaching (autodidactic), self-motivated and self-starting (anti-akratic), and, above all, self-governed and self-owned (autonomous, independent, and free).
  
I hope this project is a good start towards that goal.  
  
Keep pushing.

## Appendix A

### Reasons to do/not to do a PhD (follow up to Section 1.2)
In Section 1.2, I asked you to think about why you want a PhD. Here are a few common reasons (by no means exhaustive) and ‘counter-points’, so to speak, to help you consider your options and make your decision.  
  
(a) Many people may want an academic career, for which a PhD from a good university is often a prerequisite. But would you still do it if you know that the academic job market (in many Western countries) is in steady decline since the 1970s/1980s and has mostly collapsed? Most PhD graduates won’t land a career-track academic job (see Section 4), even though you are really good and work incredibly hard. Those who land career-track academic jobs may still spend years on the market, particularly in small countries where the academic market is tiny with too many PhDs competing for a few positions. Large countries are only marginally better.  
  
(b) For international students, if you want a PhD as your ‘passport’ to global mobilities to be able to work internationally in any country with better opportunities, do you know that some major/powerful countries mainly employ local PhD graduates (both in academia and in the industry/other sectors)? If you know that, would you still do your PhD in a small or young or developing country that is less established academically and ranked lower in the global academic hierarchy, even though otherwise the country looks attractive?  
  
(c) Some people may pursue a research career in the industry or the public/non-profit sector, for which a PhD is an asset or an entry ticket. But if that’s the goal, would you choose to do a PhD in an area that offers purely cultural and intellectual value, but doesn’t train you for anything directly applicable, productive, or practical?  
  
(d) If your goal is merely to gain credentials, then it probably doesn’t matter in which area/discipline you do your PhD (a purely cultural/intellectual area may be even better than an applied/practical one), and a local PhD is probably better than a foreign one (regardless of the global academic hierarchy), although you still need to choose a top university and an elite programme. However, in this case, the question is why you want to do a PhD—there are other (better) ways to build up your profile with far less cost and risks.  
  
(e) 'Intellectual pursuits are important for me'. Yes, then you can do it as a hobby/interest in your own time. Institutionalised academic research may not be the best way towards intellectual freedom--it may even be the opposite--and true intellectual freedom doesn't necessarily start (nor will it stop) with graduate training.  
  
Again, I raise these questions, not to be cynical or discourage you from graduate school, but to ask you to think clearly and strategically about the cost and benefit as well as potential risks and possible outcomes. Once again, this can be a life-changing decision, and you should take it very seriously. Read the books above to help you make the right decision.

## Appendix B
  
### The Underlying Thinking
  
If you have read through this project and all the books that I recommended, you’ll probably see the connections and the recurring patterns among those books and in my underlying approaches.  
  
I would highlight the following philosophies and principles behind my thinking:  
  
- Critical realism
- Skeptical empiricism
- Realistic optimism
- Pragmatic idealism
- Empirical creativity
- Creative tension
- Creative discipline
- Humble confidence
- Confident humility
  
You’ll pick up most of these terms when you read the books in Sections 3-7, save for ‘critical realism’, which comes from the philosophical foundation behind my own research.  
  
Of course, these concepts are different, but for me they are more or less the same if we focus on the connections among these different terms.  
  
You can see that my focus is consistently on learning and self-growth to change the way we think and act (to build humble confidence or confident humility), the importance of reality (realistic optimism, pragmatic idealism, or empirical creativity), the limits of knowledge and experience (critical realism and skeptical empiricism), and the ultimate goal towards personal mastery, freedom, and independence through principles and disciplines (creative tension and creative discipline).  
  
I hope I have been able to engage these different but connected approaches to present the current project. Once again, you don’t need to agree with me on anything discussed here; it’s good enough if this project makes you *think* and start to *act*.  
  
Thank you for bearing with me through this incredible journey.

### How to learn hard things and produce results

Doing and finishing a PhD is hard. There are strategies and tactics you can use, and the resources above have already covered a lot of ground from the ‘20-mile march’ to ‘deep work’.

Here are some additional resources that may be useful.

(a) How to keep going with no end in sight, that you can’t predict whether you would succeed or how long it will take, like doing a PhD?

See [this part of Ryan O'Donnell’s video](https://youtu.be/YFUIPg8P2sY?t=140) (you can stop at 6’15”).

Ignore the context if you are not in Math or CS, but take the message. This is a nice way to talk about the ‘1% rule’, which is akin to the 20-mile march principle.

(b) Some [techniques to learn hard things](https://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/programming/learn-programming-languages-efficiently/) from Daniel Higginbotham.  

Again, ignore the context, and focus on the message that can be used in other areas.  

(c) A [short note on self-teaching strategies](https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/#Studying%20Strategies) (not sure who wrote this).  

A word of caution: if you are getting into a completely different field with very little prior knowledge, then the amount of 'research' you need to do will be humongous if you follow this method, and will grow exponentially as you progress.  

It may still work (I've done it a couple of times), but if you are 100% committed to a new field that you are trying to get into, then it's probably better to follow a more sequential method to lay the foundation and progress more systematically, whether you start from bottom-up or top-down (see section (d) below).  

There are always pros and cons in each approach that you'll need to balance to make it work for you.  

(d) Some [very good reflections on education](https://www.fast.ai/2016/10/08/teaching-philosophy/) (from the pitfall of the conventional philosophy to more effective self-teaching, doing a PhD, and progressing further).

Worth reading.
