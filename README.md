## Introduction

### 0.1 Purpose
This project is to help you prepare for your PhD/Graduate School.
  
Ideally you should read through the list and the books before you start graduate school, although students at any stage of their graduate training (and perhaps early-career researchers) could benefit from this project.

### 0.2 Terminology
I use mixed terms from both the US and the UK/Commonwealth academic systems.

For example, 'graduate school' seems to come from the US, while 'postgraduate student' appears more common in the UK system. I use 'graduate school' and 'graduate students' for consistency, or just 'PhD' as shorthand.

Also, a book-length PhD research is called a 'dissertation' in the US, but a 'thesis' in the UK system. To add to the confusion, a shorter piece of research is called a 'thesis' in the former, but a 'dissertation' in the latter.

Plus, 'dissertation committee' is mainly a US thing, and so is the expression of 'ABD' ('all but dissertation'). These terms may be confusing if you are not in the US or not familiar with its graduate training system.

For research supervision, I use 'advisor' and 'supervsior' interchangeably.

I also use 'academia' and 'academe' to mean the same thing--the academic world that we work in.

For job search, the conventions, processes, and terminology also differ in the US, the UK/Australasia, continental Europe, and other countries and territories. 'Tenure' and 'tenure-track' are used in the US (and have been borrowed by an increasing number of universities elsewhere), which is equivalent to 'permanent', 'continuing', or 'confirmation-path' in some other countries. I use 'career-track' as shorthand.

Don't worry if these seem confusing. You'll get the hang of it as you progress towards your PhD (and future career if you work in academe).

### 0.3 Areas/Disciplines
I was trained across the social science and the arts and humanities, with a long-term interest in other subjects including science, business, and other theoretical and applied areas.

This project was developed in HASS (Humanities and Social Sciences) but should also benefit students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).

Overall, I draw insights from many areas and sectors of academe and society, and this project is interdisciplinary in nature (the way I intended).

### 0.4 Disclaimer
This project is based on my personal philosophy and shaped by my experience. Your supervisors may have different views. Always check with them.

## 1. Before You Start

### 1.1 The Goal
There's only one goal:

- **Complete your PhD (or other graduate degrees) on time.**

'On time' should be interpreted differently and strategically depending on your field and career goal.

(a) If you want an industry job and your PhD is in a field with a matching industry to work in, you should aim to finish your PhD as fast as possible.

Set your own deadline much earlier than the standard one. Strive to achieve it. If anything went wrong and you couldn't finish your PhD earlier, you can still finish it 'on time'. If you follow the standard timeline and something went wrong, you won’t get it on time.

(b) If you want an academic job, you should utilise the maximum funded time of your PhD to build up your publication and network.

Still set your own deadline a bit earlier. If you can meet it, don't submit your PhD and give up on your funding earlier; use the 'extra time' to get more publications, then submit your PhD 'on time' when the funding ends.

Again, if anything went wrong and you couldn't finish it earlier, you can still finish it 'on time'. Be strategic.

### 1.2 Visions
The purpose of graduate research and the 'big picture':

- Push the boundary of knowledge
- Benefit people and society
- Make the world a better place

The vision is necessarily 'lofty'. Dream big. Aim high.
Then work hard (and smart) to achieve it.

### 1.3 Principles
- **Communication**
- **Strategy**
- **Execution**
- **Productivity**
- **Resilience**

### 1.4 Methods
Here's how you do it:
- Communicate, communicate, communicate
- Think strategically
- Execute effectively
- Produce more (with less input)
- Adapt to changes and mistakes

**Communication:**  
If you have a question, ask. If you're unsure about something, check with your advisor. If you are falling behind the schedule, tell your advisor to work out a strategy.  

**Strategy & Execution:**  
(a) Keep a sharp focus on the most important things that will help you achieve your goal (complete the PhD on time).  
(b) Talk with your supervisor about strategy: what you should focus on, how to proceed with your research, and where to publish it.  
(c) Once you have a strategy, do it. Start now and carry on. Review and reflect regularly on both your strategy and execution. Figure out what works, what doesn't, and how to improve.  

Also check out the books in section 3.3 below.

**Productivity:**  
Productivity is essentially the ratio between the input and the output. Two ways to think about it:  
(a) More input, more output (work hard).  
(b) Less input, more output (work smart).  

The former means you are 'productive' in the sense that you are producing more research outputs, but 'more input' means you are investing lots of hours and resources to achieve it. This is necessary when you first start, need to catch up, change your area, pursue your PhD in a different country using a different language, or want to achieve more (more than required).  

The latter is to improve your productivity--in the long run, that's the only thing that matters. Less input and more output should always be the goal but may be difficult to achieve. It needs constant learning, upskilling, reflecting, testing, and polishing to improve, and it's a never-ending process.  

In reality, most people need to balance the two: work hard to produce, but always look for ways to work smart to reduce the input while maintaining or even increasing the output. Section 3.2 below would be helpful.  
  
**Resilience:**  
(a) Develop your ability to adapt to changes, losses, and adversities.  
(b) Learn to deal with setbacks, blunders, and downright failures and mistakes. Embrace them. That's how you learn.  
(c) Bounce back after minor and major fallouts and everything in between. They are part of life and part of your PhD.  
(d) Learn to work and perform under stress and time constraint.  
(e) Flexibility, adaptability, and perseverance are the key.

## 2. Philosophy of PhD Training
### 2.1 Overview
>[Doing a PhD] is like to be in the SAS. Once you have passed through extreme training, most normal activities are no longer stimulating, because your brain’s standard for what counts as excitement has been raised, and indeed can never go back.
>
>  Andrew Oswald, Professor of Economics & Behavioural Science, University of Warwick (cited [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/workload-survival-guide-for-academics))

You should read Oswald's part in that article, as I've quoted him out of context. 

He's talking about workload for career academics, and what he hasn't spelled out is that, once you are used to working hard during your PhD, then the heavy workload that is common in today's academia won't be a problem once you start your academic career.

The workload issue is another topic. My focus is on his point that doing a PhD is like going through training in the special force--once you've gone through it, all other challenges will appear small and trivial.

I consider this an ideal outcome and what we should aim for in PhD training. Your mileage may vary. Your supervisor may think differently.

Nonetheless, good PhD training should help students develop transferable skills for their future work and life with long-term benefits. If done right, it should prepare the students for whatever comes next.

I also believe that PhD is not for the faint-hearted (if it's easy, everyone would be doing it). You need to be ready for this, and there's no goofing around. If you choose the graduate school because you don't know what to do after college, I'd suggest two options: do something else with a better financial return, or figure out what you want during your PhD (it doesn’t need to be an academic career).

You don't need to agree with me, but think about this before starting.

### 2.2 Focus Areas
- **Skill development (hard × soft) for work and life**
- **Strong core knowledge × interdisciplinary methods**
- **Structured training × individual discovery**
- **Strategic thinking × dynamic balance**
- **Sharp focus × broad periphery view**

This section is a draft that may be revised later.

#### 2.2.1 Skill Development
- **Research & Analysis**
- **Critical, Creative, Strategic Thinking**
- **Productivity & Project Management**
- **Communication & Collaboration**
- **Digital Skills & Data Skills**
- **Qualitative & Quantitative Literacy**

Details to be added later

### 3.2 Work & Life Skills

#### 3.2.1 Change how you work
- **Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World** (C Newport, 2016, Grand Central Publishing of Hachette Book Group) || *You may also want to consult his later book *Digital Minimalism* (2019) if you often find yourself distracted by social media.*
- **When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing** (DH Pink, 2018, Riverhead Books - an imprint of Penguin Random House) || *Read Part One (the first two chapters); the rest is optional.*
- **Getting Things Done (GTD)®: The Art of Stress-free Productivity, updated edition** (D Allen, 2015, Penguin Book) || *GTD is an influential method. The book is rich and dense. Take your time to go through it and then try implementing the GTD method. I suggest that you purchase a copy and consult it from time to time. There are also many websites and blogs devoted to GTD.*
- [Optional] **The Power of Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal** (J Loehr et al., 2003, Free Press) || *This book laid the foundation for energy management (vis-a-vis time management); you may find it useful if you frequently deal with heavy workloads and long hours every day and year-round, which may be typical during your PhD and in your academic life. Also search for more recent research and publications on this topic.*

**I require all my students to read these books on *productivity* and *time/energy management*. The goal is to help you get the most out of your graduate school for a productive and fulfilling life and career, if you can implement the principles and methods described in these books (and develop your own system based on these).**
  
  
#### 3.2.2 Change how you think
- **Thinking in Systems: A Primer** (DH Meadows (author) and D Wright (editor), Chelsea Green Publishing)
  
  
#### 3.2.3 Change how you use digital tools

### 3.5 Academic Writing & Publication - *start from day one*

#### 3.5.1 Generic Writing Skills
- [Optional] **
- [Optional] **
  
#### 3.5.2 The PhD Thesis/Dissertation (80,000 - 100,000 words)
- [Optional] **How to Write a Better Thesis, 3rd ed.** (D Evans et al., 2014, Springer). || *A nice little book with short chapters (easy to read). The thesis structure discussed in this book is suitable for social and behavioural sciences, but not common in the humanities and interpretive social sciences. The book also needs an update.*
- [Optional] **Helping Doctoral Students Write: Pedagogies for Supervision, 2nd ed.** (B Kamler & P Thomson, 2014, Routledge). || *The book is intended for supervisors but students can also benefit from reading it. It is suitable for those in the arts and humanities.*
  
#### 3.5.3 Journal Articles (for everyone including 'PhD by Publication')
- [Optional] **Writing Your Journal Article in Twelve Weeks: A Guide to Academic Publishing Success, 2nd ed.** (WL Belcher, 2019, University of Chicago Press). || *It's a large and heavy book (literally). It can be quite helpful for beginners if you prefer a highly structured step-by-step instruction.*
  
#### 3.5.4 Publish your PhD as a Book (humanities & interpretive social sciences)
- [Optional] **Getting It Published: A Guide for Scholars and Anyone Else Serious about Serious Books, 3rd ed.** (W Germano, 2016, University of Chicago Press).
- [Optional] **From Dissertation to Book, 2nd ed.** (W Germano, 2016, University of Chicago Press).
  
#### 3.5.5 Blogs on Academic Writing for Graduate Students
- [Optional] [The Thesis Whisperer](https://thesiswhisperer.com/)  
- [Optional] [DoctoralWriting SIG](https://doctoralwriting.wordpress.com/) 
  
**Everything in this section is optional. The best way to learn about writing and publication is to start writing and trying to get your work published FROM DAY ONE if not earlier.**

**It is important to read other people's work in your field and see how they have done it. Everything listed here can be helpful if you need some guideline, although many students have completed their PhD and published their work without resorting to these resources.**

**You need to keep a razor-sharp focus on research and publication during your PhD, which is essential for an academic career. Even you choose other areas and won't end up doing academic work (see 3.6 below), it is still good to have some publication from your PhD.**

**Also, this section hasn't covered English writing styles and grammar. Non-native-speakers may want to consult relevant books (e.g. *The Elements of Style*) and attend workshops on English writing skills.**

**Last tip: always talk to your supervisor about writing and publication; you need to publish *strategically*, especially if you are aiming for an academic career.**

### 3.6 Job Search & Career Preparation - *start from day one*

#### 3.6.1 Overview
- [Optional] **The New PhD: How to Build a Better Graduate Education** (L Cassuto & R Weisbuch, 2021, Johns Hopkins UP) || *Perhaps read the *Introduction* to understand the big picture.*

**Most PhD graduates (especially in HASS) will not get a career-track academic job. In a small country like ours, even those who can often spend 2-5 years on the market before they land a job. I ask all my PhD students to consider and prepare for a dual career track (academic and non-academic) from Day One.** 

**Check out this list to understand the academic job market: https://github.com/John-Otago/Discussions-on-Higher-Education#04-the-academic-job-market.**

**For those in the US, the Biden administration has committed to more research funding especially in STEM, which may have a flow-on effect in HASS. It is still unclear whether this will lead to another 'research boom' similar to that during the Cold War when the US invested heavily in science and technology that boosted funding for universities. It is also unclear whether this will change the academic job market.**

**Last note: networking is important for both academic and non-academic careers!**  
  
#### 3.6.2 Academic Careers
- **Surviving Your Academic Job Hunt: Advice for Humanities PhDs, 2nd ed.** (K Hume, 2011, Palgrave)  
- **The Professor Is In: The Essential Guide to Turning Your Ph.D. into a Job** (K Kelsky, 2015, Crown)  
- [Optional] **The Academic Job Search Handbook, 5th ed.** (Vick et al., 2016, U of Pennsylvania Press)  
  
**These books are most pertinent to the job search process in the US, although students in other countries will also benefit.**
  
  
#### 3.6.3 Non-Academic Careers
- **Leaving Academia: A Practical Guide (Skills for Scholars series)** (CL Caterine, 2020, Princeton UP)  
- **Going Alt-Ac: A Guide to Alternative Academic Careers** (Linder et al., 2020, Stylus Publishing)  
- **University Startups and Spin-Offs: Guide for Entrepreneurs in Academia** (M Stagars, 2015, Apress)  
- [Website] [The Versatile PhD](https://versatilephd.com/)

**Again, mostly written and published in the US and useful for students in other countries.**
