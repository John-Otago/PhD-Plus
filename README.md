## Introduction

### 0.1 Purpose
This project is to help students prepare for their PhD/Graduate School. Supervisors may also find it useful.
  
Ideally you should read through the list and the books before you start graduate school, although students at any stage of their graduate training (and perhaps early-career researchers) can benefit from this project.

Many students (including me years ago) came to graduate school underprepared, and supervisors are often deprived of time and may not be able to offer more holistic training and personal development beyond research.  
  
This project aims to develop and offer a more systematic understanding of graduate studies and more holistic training of graduate students—hence reimagining what graduate education can do and can be.  
  
### 0.2 Terminology
I use 'graduate school' and 'graduate students' for consistency, or just 'PhD' as shorthand. For research supervision, I use 'advisor' and 'supervisor' interchangeably.

I use mixed terms from both the US and the UK/Commonwealth academic systems.

For instance, a book-length PhD research is called a 'dissertation' in the US, but a 'thesis' in the UK system. To add to the confusion, a shorter piece of research is called a 'thesis' in the former, but a 'dissertation' in the latter.

Plus, 'dissertation committee' is mainly a US thing, and so is the expression of 'ABD' ('all but dissertation'). These terms may be confusing if you are not in the US or not familiar with its graduate training system.

For job search, the conventions, processes, and terminology also differ in the US, the UK/Australasia, continental Europe, and other countries and territories. 'Tenure' and 'tenure-track' are used in the US (and have been borrowed by many universities elsewhere), which is equivalent to 'permanent', 'continuing', or 'confirmation-path' in some other countries. I use 'career-track' as shorthand.

Don't worry if these seem confusing. You'll get the hang of it as you progress towards your PhD (and future career if you work in academia).

### 0.3 Areas/Disciplines
This project is developed in HASS (Humanities and Social Sciences) but should also benefit students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and other fields.

I draw insights from many areas and sectors, and this project is interdisciplinary in nature (the way I intended). The so-called ‘disciplines’ and ‘boundaries’ are artificial (albeit not arbitrary). Think in systems, not in disciplines.  
  
### 0.4 Disclaimer
This project is based on my personal philosophy and shaped by my experience. Your supervisors may have different views. Always check with them.

This is an ongoing project that will take years to develop. It is time-consuming as I need to select and read a large number of books and other resources to make recommendations and keep them up to date. I also constantly re-think and re-evaluate my approaches to make changes regularly. The mental work as well as reading and writing already took me hundreds of hours before this project first went public. It will continue to take more time to build and maintain. 
  
Keep in mind that this project is to inspire new ways of thinking and explore new approaches to graduate training. I have my principles that you may not necessarily agree with, and the world keeps changing and the way we think and train students must change accordingly (we have been kicking the can down the road for too long and missed many opportunities; see e.g. my collection of relevant discussions [here](https://github.com/John-Otago/Discussions-on-Higher-Education/blob/main/README.md#08-relevant-books)—there are many more books and commentaries published on this topic). The Covid-19 pandemic has signalled an epochal shift and let’s take the opportunity to drive changes and innovation.  

I welcome feedback and input from students, advisors, and everyone else. This is a Project as a Service (PaaS) that I would like to keep in [perpetual beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_beta) that can be constantly tested and updated.

## 1. Philosophy of PhD Training
  
### 1.1 What is a PhD?
So, *qu'est-ce que le PhD* (what is the PhD)?

Check out [The Illustrated Guide to a Ph.D.](https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/) by [Matt Might](https://matt.might.net).

There's a story behind it (watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oud2tbtO2z8)). Here's the [blog post](https://matt.might.net/articles/my-sons-killer/). Here's a [longer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTZoJLHofBE). The story is well-known in the research community.

I hope you get it. Whatever the reason you choose to do a PhD, I hope you picked up something from this incredible story.

Keep pushing.  
  
### 1.2 Why Do You Want a PhD?
The reason above may not explain *your* motivation/rationale to pursue a PhD, nor it can fully account for various kinds of reasons that people choose to do a PhD.
  
If your supervisor hasn’t asked you why you choose graduate school, you should ask yourself that question before you start and have a *really* clear answer, rather than a vague impression that this is something you ‘should’ do or ‘like’ to do.
  
There are probably many other things that you should do or would enjoy doing, but why a PhD—a multiyear commitment and hard work with great risks and opportunity cost?
  
I raise this question, not to be cynical or discourage you from graduate school, but to ask you to think *clearly* and *strategically* about why you want a PhD, where and when you should do your PhD, in which discipline(s), at what cost, and with what kind of possible outcomes. This is potentially a life-changing decision, for better or for worse, and you shouldn’t make it carelessly or without being informed about the reality.
  
I’ve seen so many PhD graduates end up jobless after graduate school and have to collect unemployment benefits, or can only find work in sales, retail, restaurants, supermarkets, or drive cabs (all real-life examples)—it’s not that these jobs are ‘below’ anyone, but that our PhD graduates are competing with high school dropouts for these jobs that don’t need a college degree. International students may not even be allowed to stay in the country if they don’t have a job that matches their PhD once their visa runs out. Some degree-holders may find themselves essentially unemployable or severely under-employed, especially if they did their PhD in a non-applied area, although this problem can occur to any PhD student in any discipline. 
  
As I show below in the rest of this project, PhD training, if done right, offers great benefits for life—it’s just that many PhD students (me included) come to graduate school without a clear understanding of what it’s *really* like out there, and still hold naive views and wishful thinking until they are tested in real life—often followed by a rude awakening.
  
As a bare minimum, think about the trade-off between the cost and the potential benefit, and calculate possible risks and outcomes, ideally before you start graduate school. Some of the resources below will help you (see also [Appendix A](https://github.com/John-Otago/PhD-Plus/blob/main/README.md#appendix-a)). At least, you should be able to clearly answer the question ‘why do you want to do a PhD’ and have a Plan B (and keep working towards it) in case your PhD doesn’t work out or doesn’t lead to the outcome you initially had in mind—that seems to be the case for many of today’s (under-prepared) PhDs.
  
Keep in mind that ‘enjoying it’ (a hobby) or ‘good at it’ (a skill) shouldn’t justify doing research at graduate school as your full-time job (a career) or what you do with your life (a future). You should take other more practical issues into account, like *whether you should pursue something else that you will also ace and enjoy*, *whether you can support yourself after graduate school without a job*, and *what if your PhD only leads to a career that doesn’t need graduate degrees*. That’s a necessary process before you make this major and life-changing investment called a PhD.
  
### 1.3 What is PhD Training?
Now, what is it like to go through PhD training?
  
Consider this quote:
  
>[Doing a PhD] is like to be in the SAS. Once you have passed through extreme training, most normal activities are no longer stimulating [...].
>
>  -- Andrew Oswald, Professor of Economics & Behavioural Science, University of Warwick (cited [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/workload-survival-guide-for-academics))

You should read Oswald's part in that article, as I've quoted him out of context (he's talking about academics' heavy workload).
  
My focus is on his point that doing a PhD is like going through training in the special force--once you've passed through it, all other challenges will appear small and trivial.

I consider this an ideal outcome and what we should aim for in PhD training. Your mileage may vary. Your supervisor may think differently.

Nonetheless, good PhD training should help students develop transferable skills for their future work and life with long-term benefits. If done right, it should prepare the students for whatever comes next.

I also believe that PhD is not for the faint-hearted (if it's easy, everyone would do it). You need to be ready for this, and there's no goofing around. If you choose the graduate school because you don't know what to do after college, I'd suggest two options: do something else with a better financial return, or figure out what you want during your PhD (it doesn’t need to be an academic career).

You don't need to agree with me, but think about this before starting.  
  
I know I might have been glorifying Graduate School—it’s definitely not all rosy—but if you *really* want to do a PhD, I hope you can get the most out of it.
  
### 1.4 The Philosophy (sort of)
The philosophy of PhD training is to help students develop the mindset and the skillset to become informed and effective lifelong learners and doers who are self-learning and self-teaching (autodidactic), self-motivated and self-starting (anti-akratic), and, above all, self-governed and self-owned (autonomous, independent, and free).  
  
Freedom is the ultimate goal. Freedom is never free—it can only be achieved through careful thinking, doing, tinkering, and risk-taking. It is hard work, and graduate school offers a good training opportunity.  

Graduate training is not the only way to achieve this goal, and this process entails lifelong development beyond formal education. Nonetheless, it is a desirable outcome to aim for while you are in graduate school.

## 2. Before You Start
  
### 2.1 The Vision
The purpose of graduate research and the 'big picture':

- Push the boundary of knowledge
- Benefit people and society
- Make the world a better place

The vision is necessarily 'lofty'. Dream big. Aim high.  
Then work hard (and smart) every day to achieve it.  

### 2.2 The Goal
There's only one goal when you are in graduate school:

- **Complete your PhD (or other graduate degrees) on time.**

The goal is necessarily specific and 'down to earth'.  
  
#### 'On time' should be interpreted strategically depending on your field and career goal.

(a) If you want an industry job, and your PhD is in a field with a matching industry to work in, you should aim to finish your PhD as fast as possible.

Set your own deadline much earlier than the standard one. Strive to achieve it. If anything went wrong and you couldn't finish your PhD earlier, you can still finish it 'on time'. If you follow the standard timeline and something went wrong, you won’t get it on time.

(b) If you want an academic job, and/or your PhD is in a field of purely intellectual knowledge without an applied industry to work in, you should utilise the maximum funded time of your PhD to build up your publication and network.  

Still set your own deadline a bit earlier. If you can meet it, don't submit your PhD and give up on your funding earlier; use the 'extra time' to get more publications, then submit your PhD 'on time' when the funding ends. I learnt this the hard way by submitting my PhD earlier and giving up on one-year's funding, which turned out to be a strategic mistake.

Again, if anything went wrong and you couldn't finish it earlier, you can still finish it 'on time'. Be strategic.  
  
#### This strategy serves a purpose. Think about the following two scenarios, and which one you’d like to end up in:

- Always one step ahead (busy but relaxed)
- Always one step behind (busy *and* stressed)

You’d be happier during your PhD if you can keep a sense of relaxed control by being one step ahead (or more). You will be stressed if you are often behind or find yourself in a rush to *just* meet the deadline.

Some books I recommend below (Sections 3-7) can help you better understand and carry out this strategy to achieve this goal.
  
### 2.3 Principles
- **Communication**
- **Strategy**
- **Execution**
- **Productivity**
- **Resilience**

### 2.4 Methods
Here's how you do it:
- Communicate, communicate, communicate
- Think strategically
- Execute effectively
- Work productively
- Adapt to changes and mistakes

**Communication:**  
If you have a question, ask. If you're unsure about anything, check with your advisor. If you are falling behind the schedule, tell your advisor to work out a strategy.  
  
**Strategy & Execution:**  
(a) Focus on the things that will help you achieve your goal (complete the PhD on time) while developing useful skills.  
(b) Talk with your supervisor about strategy: what you should focus on, how to proceed with your research, and where to publish it.  
(c) Once you have a strategy, do it. Start now and carry on. Review and reflect regularly on both your strategy and execution. Figure out what works, what doesn't, and how to improve it.  
  
**Productivity:**  
Productivity is essentially the ratio between the input and the output. Two ways to think about it:  
(a) More input, more output (work hard).  
(b) Less input, more output (work smart).  

The former means you are 'productive' in the sense that you are producing more research outputs, but 'more input' means you are investing lots of hours and resources to achieve it. This is necessary when you first start, need to catch up, change your area, pursue your PhD in a different country using a different language, or simply want to achieve more (more than required).  

The latter is to improve your productivity--in the long run, that's the only thing that matters. Less input and more output should always be the goal but may be difficult to achieve. It needs constant learning, upskilling, reflecting, testing, and polishing to improve, and it's a never-ending process.  

In reality, most people need to balance the two: work hard to produce, but always look for ways to work smart to reduce the input while maintaining or even increasing the output. 
  
**Resilience:**  
(a) Develop your ability to adapt to changes, losses, and adversities.  
(b) Learn to deal with setbacks, blunders, and downright failures and mistakes. Embrace them. That's how you learn.  
(c) Bounce back after minor and major fallouts (and everything in between). They are part of life and part of your PhD.  
(d) Learn to work and perform under stress and time constraint.  
(e) Flexibility, adaptability, and perseverance are the key.  
(f) Build and improve resilience: build redundancy into the system, make back-up plans, don't put all the eggs in one basket, build multiple pillars to support work and life, expect and live with ups and downs, don't rely exclusively on that 'one shot' that may or may not work, keep an open mind and a good peripheral vision, and don't get caught up in a tunnelled vision that obscures the big picture.

### 4. Career Preparation - *start from day one*
  
### 4.1 Overview
It comes as a sobering fact for some PhD students/graduates that most of them will never get a career-track academic job (especially in HASS). That includes many good PhD graduates with a track record of publication and excellent teaching experience. The academic job market follows the simple rule of supply and demand (over-supply and weak/declining demand). No matter how good you are, there are simply too many candidates on the market. Ignoring this rule will cost you dearly. Plan ahead when you start graduate school, not when you finish.  
  
Check out this list to understand the (mostly collapsed) academic job market: https://github.com/John-Otago/Discussions-on-Higher-Education/blob/main/README.md#04-the-academic-job-market.  
  
If you come from a typical middle-class family or from a culture that highly values education, you may 'naturally' believe that more education will lead to more opportunities--that's not necessarily true.  
  
In a small country, even those who can land a career-track academic job often spend 2-5 years on the market (again, many good and more experienced candidates are waiting ahead of you). In a large country, you have to be both very good and very lucky. The same rule applies to post-docs.  
  
International students should also think about in which country they are going to do their PhD: a doctorate in a leading country at the top of the academic hierarchy may earn you the entry ticket to global mobility and allow you to consider jobs in most countries you are willing to work in; the reverse is unlikely to be true (i.e. a PhD earned in a country with less academic prowess may confine your career to the local market, as the bigger players often prefer their own graduates trained in their own systems).  
  
For those in the US, the Biden administration has committed to more research funding especially in STEM, which may have a flow-on effect in HASS. It is still unclear whether this will lead to another 'research boom' similar to that during the Cold War when the US invested heavily in science and technology that boosted funding for universities. It is also unclear whether this will change the academic job market.  

Overall, I ask all my PhD students to consider and prepare for a dual career track (academic and non-academic) from Day One.

Keep in mind that these books were written in the US, and you need to tailor the content to your own environment.  

The first book offers a good overview (matter-of-factly, as if most PhD graduates can find a career-track job in today’s academic market). The next two tell you what it's really like ‘out there’ and how difficult it can be, while offering practical advice.  

All three books need an update, perhaps in a few years after Covid-19 as the pandemic may have a lasting impact on the market. I do recommend that you read all these books at the *beginning* of graduate school, and revisit them (perhaps updated editions) when you are ready to look for jobs in academia.  
  
### 4.3 Non-Academic Careers

Again, all from the US. Students in other countries should pick up the key points and apply them to the local context.  
  
### 4.4 University Start-ups & Innovation-Driven Entrepreneurship
- **The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses** (E Ries, 2011, Currency)
- [Optional] **Research to Revenue: A Practical Guide to University Start-Ups** (D Rose & C Patterson, 2016, University of North Carolina Press)
- [Optional] MIT open course (15.390) and MOOC (15.390x) on Innovation-Driven Entrepreneurship || *You can find it on [EdX]( https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/online-learning/), YouTube ([here]( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCalob7RKVi8MsKjMmpiyZzw) and [here]( https://www.youtube.com/MITBootcamps)), or [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-390-new-enterprises-spring-2013/). You can also sign up for the [bootcamp](https://bootcamps.mit.edu/bootcamps/innovation-leadership/)*

### 4.5 Become an SME Owner-Operator or Sole-Proprietor
- [Optional] **Small Business Management: Theory & Practice**, 4th ed. (T Mazzarol & S Reboud, 2020, Springer)
- [Optional] **Workbook for Small Business Management: Theory and Practice**, 4th ed. (T Mazzarol & S Reboud, 2020, Springer)

Starting and running a small business or SME (small-or-medium-sized enterprise) is different from launching an innovation-driven startup to carve out a non-existing market. A few books above on non-academic careers have mentioned how some PhD graduates (esp. those in HASS) have launched their consultancy or writing/editing services, who count as owner-operators of small businesses (or sole-traders/proprietors).  
  
The books in this section offer basic introductions. Practice is much more important than theory, whether you want to launch a startup or become a small business owner-manager. Your local small business council or association may be able to help, and there are lots of relevant resources online. You need to learn from people with real-life business experiences, not researchers.  
  
Last note: networking is important for both academic and non-academic careers!

### 5. Academic Writing & Publication - *start from day one*
  
### 5.1 Writing Skills
- [Optional] **Writing for Social Scientists: How to Start and Finish Your Thesis, Book, or Article, 3rd ed.** (HS Becker, 2020, University of Chicago Press) || *It’s a nice read on ‘how to think about writing’, not a step-by-step guideline for students (see 5.3 if you prefer a highly structured guide).*
  
- [Optional] **On Revision: The Only Writing that Counts** (W Germano, 2021, University of Chicago Press) || *An interesting little book, completely optional.*
  
### 5.2 The PhD Thesis/Dissertation
- [Optional] **How to Write a Better Thesis, 3rd ed.** (D Evans et al., 2014, Springer). || *A nice little book with short chapters (easy to read). The thesis structure discussed in this book is suitable for social and behavioural sciences, but not common in the humanities and interpretive social sciences. The book also needs an update.*
  
- [Optional] **Helping Doctoral Students Write: Pedagogies for Supervision, 2nd ed.** (B Kamler & P Thomson, 2014, Routledge). || *The book is intended for supervisors but students can also benefit from reading it. It is suitable for those in the arts and humanities.*
  
### 5.3 Journal Articles
- [Optional] **Writing Your Journal Article in Twelve Weeks: A Guide to Academic Publishing Success, 2nd ed.** (WL Belcher, 2019, University of Chicago Press). || *It's a large and heavy book (literally), helpful for beginners who prefer highly structured step-by-step instructions.*
  
### 5.4 Publish your PhD as a Book (humanities & humanistic social sciences)
- [Optional] **Getting It Published: A Guide for Scholars and Anyone Else Serious about Serious Books, 3rd ed.** (W Germano, 2016, University of Chicago Press).
- [Optional] **From Dissertation to Book, 2nd ed.** (W Germano, 2016, University of Chicago Press).

- [Optional] [DoctoralWriting SIG](https://doctoralwriting.wordpress.com/)
  
---
Everything here is optional. The best way to learn about writing and publication is to *read other people's work and see how they have done it, and start writing and getting your work published FROM DAY ONE if not earlier*. The books listed here can be helpful if you need some guidelines.  
  
Keep a razor-sharp focus on research and publication if you want an academic career. Even if you won't end up doing academic work, it is still good to have publications during your PhD.  
  
Also, this section hasn't covered English writing styles and grammar. You may consult relevant books (e.g. *The Elements of Style*) and attend workshops on writing skills.  
  
I agree with Howard Becker that, for native-speakers, the skills required to write well are already taught in entry-level composition classes. Becker has shared the following example in *Writing for Social Scientists* (2020, pp. 5-6):  
  
>Sociologists habitually use twenty words where two will do.
  
To reduce wordiness:  
>With my pencil poised over a word or clause, I asked, "Does this need to be here? If not, I'm taking it out." [...] I changed passive to active constructions, combined sentences, took long sentences apart—all the things [that] students might well have once learned to do in freshman composition. 
  
Result?  
>At the end of three hours, we had reduced four pages to three-quarters of a page without losing nuance or essential details.
  
Think about this.  
  
Another rule of thumb: read good papers/books and consciously adopt good wording and phrasing in your own writing. Read broadly and don't limit your reading to your own field or only to academic literature.  
  
Last tip:  
  
Always talk to your supervisor about writing and publication; you need to publish *strategically*, especially if you are aiming for an academic career.  
  
Selecting journals and publishers is VERY important but rarely discussed openly and publicly, especially in HASS. Check another project of mine [Selected Journals in HASS](https://github.com/John-Otago/Selected-Journals-in-HASS) as well as my collection of [relevant news reports and discussions](https://github.com/John-Otago/Discussions-on-Higher-Education/blob/main/README.md#06-research-and-publication).

## 6. Become Self-Owned
  
### 6.1 Change How You Think
- **Thinking in Systems: A Primer** (written by DH Meadows, edited by D Wright, 2008, Chelsea Green Publishing) || *Start from this one before you proceed to other books on systems thinking (e.g. **The Fifth Discipline**).*
  
- **Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know** (A Grant, 2021, Viking)
  
- **Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much** (S Mullainathan & E Shafir, 2013, Times Books) || *Read Chapters 1-2 and 6, and perhaps skim through 7-10.*
  
- **Incerto** (NN Taleb, 2019/2021, Random House) || *This is a collection of five books. Read them all, or at least **Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder** (2012/2014). You don’t need to agree with the author on everything, but take in the key points.*
  
- [Optional] **Thinking, Fast and Slow** (D Kahneman, 2011, Farrar, Straus & Giroux) || *If you read this book, be aware that many studies cited in the text cannot serve as scientific evidence for the author’s arguments (see [here]( https://replicationindex.com/2020/12/30/a-meta-scientific-perspective-on-thinking-fast-and-slow/))*
  
The first few books are must-read. The last one is optional.
  
### 6.2 Change How You Work
- **Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World** (C Newport, 2016, Grand Central Publishing of Hachette Book Group) || *Also consult his later book *Digital Minimalism* (2019) if you find yourself distracted by social media.*
  
- **Getting Things Done (GTD)®: The Art of Stress-free Productivity, updated edition** (D Allen, 2015, Penguin Book) || *GTD is a great method. The book is rich and dense; take your time to go through it and try implementing the method. You may purchase a copy and consult it from time to time. There are also many online resources devoted to GTD.*
  
- **Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much** (S Mullainathan & E Shafir, 2013, Times Books) || *It’s included here again because it has implications on how we work and is relevant to the two books on time/energy management below*.
  
- **When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing** (DH Pink, 2018, Riverhead Books of Penguin Random House) || *Read Part One (the first two chapters); the rest is optional.*
  
- **The Power of Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal** (J Loehr & T Schwartz, 2003, Free Press) || *This book is about energy management (vis-a-vis time management); you'll find it useful if you frequently deal with heavy workloads and long hours, which may be typical during your PhD and in your academic life.*

You should read these books. The goal is to help you get the most out of your graduate school for a productive and fulfilling life and career, if you can implement the principles and methods described in these books (and perhaps develop your own system based on these).
  
### 6.3 Change How You Communicate
- **How to Get Your Point Across in 30 Seconds or Less** (MO Frank, 1986/1990, Simon & Schuster) || *It’s an old book that may still be useful if you can find a copy.*
  
- **Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High, 3rd ed.** (J Grenny et al., 2021, McGraw Hill) || *Frankly I don't think the book is well-written, but the method described therein can be quite helpful.*
  
These books can help improve your communication skills in everyday life and in your career. You may also consult other titles and resources on this topic.  
  
### 6.4 Change Your Habits  
- **The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business** (C Duhigg, 2012/2014, Random House) || *Read Part One (Chapters 1-3) and the first half of Part Two (Chapters 4-5).*
  
- [Optional] **Atomic Habits** (J Clear, 2018, Random House) || *This one is completely optional.*  

These books can help you cultivate good habits and break bad ones, especially when you find yourself struggling to break a 'vicious cycle' or build a 'virtuous' habit. It is a useful skill for both your PhD and your future life and career.
   
### 6.5 Change How You Deal with Emotions
- [Optional] **Emotional Agility: Get Unstuck, Embrace Change, and Thrive in Work and Life** (S David, 2016, Avery, of Penguin Random House) || *I find Chapter 6 enlightening; you can consult other chapters if you find them useful.*
  
### 6.6 Change How You Use Digital Tools
- Note-taking: try the new generation of note-taking tools that have emerged since 2020: [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), or [RemNote](https://www.remnote.io/). You can find lots of online tutorials (e.g. videos and blog posts) teaching you how to use these tools and how they differ from each other. Do your research and choose your favourite one :)
  
- [Optional] **The Joy of Search: A Google Insider's Guide to Going Beyond the Basics** (DM Russell, 2019, MIT Press) || *It's useful for secondary research like fact-checking and basic info gathering; Chapters 6 and 10 are particularly good.*

## 7. Become Self-Owned (continued)
  
### 7.1 Principles & Disciplines  
  
- **Incerto** (NN Taleb, 2019/2021, Random House) || *You’ve read **Antifragile** as recommended in 6.1? Good. Now go and read the rest of the collection. Again, you don't need to agree with the author on everything, but think about the points he has raised.*
  
- **Principles: Life & Work** (R Dalio, 2017, Simon & Schuster) || *You may find this book only partially useful—read it anyway if you haven’t. This title is followed by two other books by the same author if you are interested.*
  
- **The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, 30th-anniversary edition.** (SR Covey, [1989] 2020, Free Press, of Simon & Schuster) || *Presumably most people have read this old classic--please do read it if you haven't.*
  
- **The Power of Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal** (J Loehr & T Schwartz, 2003, Free Press) || *I’ve already recommended this book. It covers both practical issues and important underlying principles to help us organise our life and work.*  
  
- **Great by Choice: Uncertainty, Chaos, and Luck--Why Some Thrive Despite Them All** (J Collins & MT Hansen, 2011, Random House) || *Same here: read it if you haven't. Also feel free to consult other books by Jim Collins.*
  
### 7.2 Strategy & Execution
- **Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less** (G McKeown, 2014/2020, Currency/Crown)
- **Effortless: Make it Easier to Do What Matters Most** (G McKeown, 2021, Currency/Virgin Books)
- **The 4 Disciplines of Execution: Achieving Your Wildly Important Goals, 2nd ed.** (C McChesney et al., 2021, Simon & Schuster)
- [Optional] **The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of the Learning Organization** (PM Senge, [1990] 2006, Doubleday) || *Completely optional if you have read **Thinking in Systems** that I recommended above. Or perhaps read only Part I and Part II (the first seven chapters).*

I would say that these books are all 'more or less useful' (rather than 'downright excellent'). You should read them and see how helpful they are.

It's particularly difficult to find a good book on generic strategic thinking. Strategy is mostly discussed in the military, foreign affairs and national security, and business management. Few people talk about how it functions in everyday life.  

In fact, many people already engage strategic thinking on a day-to-day basis, from planning to decision-making, although most of them are not conscious that what they do is ‘strategy’.  

I truly believe that strategic thinking is an essential skill in today’s world to help people think, plan, and realise their goals and potential. Strategy is what gets you from A to B, or from where you are to where you want to be.  

You can always read [*The Art of War*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War), which has already been applied to many respects of everyday life. You can also check out Yale’s [Brady-Johnson Program in Grand Strategy](https://grandstrategy.yale.edu/) and relevant publications, although grand strategy is still different from everyday strategic thinking. There are many books talking about business strategies, too.  

Anyway, keep in mind that sometimes the best strategy is a good night's sleep :)  
  
### 7.3 Decision-Making & Problem-Solving
#### Decision-Making
- **Decisive: How to Make Better Choices in Life and Work** (UK version: **Decisive: How to Make Better Decisions**) (C Heath & D Heath, 2013, Currency) || *Highly recommended. Part I (Chapters 2-4) is particularly good. If you only read one book about decision-making, this should be the one.*
- **How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices** (A Duke, 2020, Portfolio) || *A nice summary of relevant tools that complements the first book.*
- [Optional] **Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions** (JS Hammond et al., [1999] 2015, Harvard Business Review Press)
- [Optional] **Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment** (D Kahneman et al., 2021, Little, Brown Spark)
- [Optional] **Algorithms To Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions** (B Christian & T Griffiths, 2017, Picador)

#### Problem-Solving
- [Optional] **Change: Principles of Problem Formation and Problem Resolution** (P Watzlawick et al., [1974] 2011, W. W. Norton & Company)
- [Optional] **Nudge: The Final Edition** (RH Thaler & CR Sunstein, 2021, Penguin Books) || *Read it if you haven’t heard about ‘nudge’.*

Goal-setting, decision-making, problem-solving, and risk-taking are all important and integral to our work and life. Read widely on these topics so you'll see the connections, but keep in mind that practice (real-life experience) is always more important than theoretical knowledge on paper.

## Closing Remarks
  
### Walk the Talk
Congratulations that you have come this far and read through the whole project. I hope you have thought about the issues I raised here, read the books I suggested in Sections 3-7, and made connections between everything you have read, learnt, and thought about.  
  
Now what?  
  
Well, you have to put everything into practice. An untested theory is merely a theory, and untested knowledge may not work in practice. There’s always a gap (or a creative tension) between theory and practice, and you have to connect them.  
  
You have to ‘walk the talk’, so to speak, to test what you have learnt: what works, what doesn’t, what needs to be tweaked, how you can improve them, and how you can make them work *for you*.  
  
In other words, you need to turn your theoretical knowledge into productive practice for continued learning and tinkering towards personal mastery and self-growth. That’s the philosophy behind this whole project and the whole process of graduate training.  
  
Embrace reality. Face the truth. Confront the facts.  
  
### *Via Negativa*
Here, *via negativa* means learning and doing by subtraction, by strategically doing less but focusing more, and by detecting and extracting what is useful from what is not, the most essential from the less important, and the mission-critical from the trivial and the marginal.  
  
To concentrate on the most important things, you have to ignore the less important ones. To seek truth and useful knowledge, you have to identify and eliminate falsehoods and theories that won’t stand real-life tests. To keep what works, you have to get rid of what doesn’t. To ask the right question and find the right problem, you have to remove the false and superficial ones.  
  
Sometimes the more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish. You should remove more instead of doing more. Lots of things are practically worthless.  
  
You have to reduce and eliminate noises, distractions, falsehoods, past beliefs, and the nonessentials, so the most crucial and the most critical can emerge.  
  
Once you have *built up* your reservoir of knowledge, you’ll need to *build down* and trim off excessive and obsolete knowledge that doesn’t work or no longer aligns with reality. Only keep what is true and what works for you, so you can reduce the vast reservoir of knowledge to concentrated essences.  
  
*Less is more*. By doing less and only the most essential, you can keep a sharp focus, align your efforts with what matters most, and direct and concentrate your physical and mental energy and resources onto your wildly important goal. ‘Doing less’ while ‘focusing more’ is the most effective and most productive way to achieve what you aim to achieve.  
  
The most useful can be the most concise. The most essential can be the simplest of all.  
  
Keep that in mind.  
  
### The End is the Beginning
The end of theory is the start of practice. The end of reading and learning is the start of doing. The end of building up is the start of building down and cutting off.  
  
The end of this project is the start of how you understand, approach, prepare for, and make the most of your graduate training, and the end of graduate school is the start of your real-life adventures.  
  
Let’s once again go back to the beginning and take another look at the philosophy behind PhD training:  
  
>The philosophy is to help students develop the mindset and the skillset to become informed and effective lifelong learners and doers who are self-learning and self-teaching (autodidactic), self-motivated and self-starting (anti-akratic), and, above all, self-governed and self-owned (autonomous, independent, and free).
  
I hope this project is a good start towards that goal.  
  
Keep pushing.

## Appendix A

### Reasons to do/not to do a PhD (follow up to Section 1.2)
In Section 1.2, I asked you to think about why you want a PhD. Here are a few common reasons (by no means exhaustive) and ‘counter-points’, so to speak, to help you consider your options and make your decision.

(a) Many people may want an academic career, for which a PhD from a good university is often a prerequisite. But would you still do it if you know that the academic job market (in many Western countries) is in steady decline since the 1970s/1980s and has already collapsed? Most PhD graduates won’t land a career-track academic job (see Section 4), even though you are really good and work incredibly hard. Those who land career-track academic jobs may still spend years on the market, particularly in small countries where the academic market is tiny with too many PhDs competing for a few positions. Large countries are only marginally better.

(b) For international students, if you want a PhD as your ‘passport’ to global mobilities to be able to work internationally in any country with better opportunities, do you know that some major/powerful countries mainly employ local PhD graduates (both in academia and in the industry/other sectors)? If you know that, would you still do your PhD in a small or young or developing country that is less established academically and ranked lower in the global academic hierarchy, even though otherwise the country looks attractive?

(c) Some people may pursue a research-related career in the industry or the public/non-profit sector, for which a PhD is an asset or an entry ticket. But if that’s the goal, would you choose to do a PhD in an area that offers purely cultural and intellectual value, but doesn’t train you for anything directly applicable, productive, or practical?

(d) If your goal is merely to gain credentials and build up your profile, then it probably doesn’t matter in which area/discipline you do your PhD (a purely cultural/intellectual area may be even better than an applied/practical one), and a local PhD is probably better than a foreign one (regardless of the global academic hierarchy), although you still need to choose a top university and an elite programme. However, in this case, the question is why you want to do a PhD—there are other (better) ways to gain credentials with far less cost and risks.

Again, I raise these questions, not to be cynical or discourage you from graduate school, but to ask you to think clearly and strategically about cost-and-benefit as well as potential risks and possible outcomes. Once again, this can be a life-changing decision, and you should take it very seriously. Read the books above in Sections 6-7 to help you make the right decision.

## Appendix B
  
### The Underlying Thinking
  
If you have read through this project and all the books that I recommended above, you’ll probably see the connections and the recurring patterns among those books and in my underlying approaches.  
  
I would highlight the following philosophies and principles behind my thinking:  
  
- Critical realism
- Skeptical empiricism
- Realistic optimism
- Pragmatic idealism
- Empirical creativity
- Creative tension
- Creative discipline
- Humble confidence
- Confident humility
  
You’ll pick up most of these terms when you read the books in Sections 3-7, save for ‘critical realism’, which comes from the philosophical foundation behind my own research.  
  
Of course, these concepts are different, but for me they are more or less the same if we focus on the connections among these different terms.  
  
You can see that my focus in this project is consistently on self-learning and self-growth to change the way we think and act (to build humble confidence or confident humility), the importance of reality (realistic optimism, pragmatic idealism, or empirical creativity), the values and limits of theoretical knowledge (critical realism and skeptical empiricism), and the ultimate goal towards personal mastery, freedom, and independence through principles and disciplines (creative tension and creative discipline).  
  
I hope I have been able to engage these different but connected approaches and principles to present the current project. Once again, you don’t need to agree with me on anything discussed here; it’s good enough if this project makes you *think* and start to explore.  
  
Thank you for bearing with me through this incredible journey.
